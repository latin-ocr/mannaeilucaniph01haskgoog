FORTUNA AND FATUM li

“ (c) As for Lucan¹s own religions beliefs, we can say little more
than that throughout the poem¹⁰ the ruling divinity is the capricious
abstraction Fortuna. She is not so much a positive divinity as a
negative substitute for one. 11 1 may venture to put sorward a rather
bold view, it seems to me that the wavering philosophy of Lucan is
'reflected in his dual religion, meaning by religion his theory 'os the

, government os the world. To me it seems that his fatum and Fortuna
⁴ are as Stoic and Epicurean: fatum is impersonal‚ but presupposes gods,
Fortuna is personified only to dispense with thern. Therelore it is
natural enough thatin the Pharsalia rt is seldom or never possible to
draw any practical distinction between Fortuna and satum: they are two
different vrews ο1 the same thing.

It was natural to personiiy Fortuna: she had been from ancient
times a goddess widely worshipped m Italy, and it was only when
the old belieis began to pass away that she came to be regarded
as a mere conventional abstraction. See Preller Rom Myth ιι pp 178

foll.

(d) To Lucan the creeds and ceremonies of men are merely details,
his knowledge ο1 which heis proud to display. And to the Spanish
provincial the old Italian worships were no more or little more than
11ιοεε,ο1 Syria or Egypt. To Vergil there was clearly a peculiar glamour
about the national religion os Italy, and his mind was ο1 a tender
reverent cast. In no respect do the two writers differ more than in
their relations to the religions ο1 their respective ages.

(36) Relation to Leaming and History.

That learning was one ο1 the most valued qualities in a
Roman poet, and that to call him doctus was one ο1 the highest
complim'entS, is become a commonplace of literary history.

, To this observation Lucan forms no exception. For a youth

who died at the ageos 26 years his display os leaming⁸⁰ is
prodigious. The Pharsalia teems with historical astronomical
geographical and technical details3 the similes and epithets
reelr os them, and everywhere we meet allusions more or less
recondite drawn srorn the vast stores ο1 myth and legend. Like
