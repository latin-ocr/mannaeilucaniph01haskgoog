cx ” RELA TION TO VERGIL

That it requires caresul and continuous reading to'appreciate
the influence of Vergil on Lucan, I readily admit. The differ-
’ enee os manner in the two writers is enormous Vergil‚ashy
lover oi the country, gentle, sympathetic‚ quiet, contemplative,
master of his learning, careful in selection, weaves together his
story unobserved and sets his imaginations in subtle harmonies
of rhythm and style. Lucan, a young city prodigy‚ hasty,
declamatory, eager to display all his undigested eruditiori and
make telling hits to catch the applause of an audience, harsh in
transitions and without sense oi proportion, poor in imagination,
-how should he give us general eflects other than those os
rhetoric? His is the hurried result of effort, Vergil’s the ripe
fruit os loving labour. .

If this be s0, why does not the influence os Vergil on Lucan
strike the eye at once? Because Lucan aiter all is not weak:
he is strong, and when he borrows he altera, sometimes perhaps
in wanton² rivalry. BesideS, many ol the parallels do strike the
eye even at a cursory glance. ἵ

Ι have now Ι think said enough by way ol opinion and

reasons in general. It remains lor a reader to examine the ’

evidence in detail and judge whether it bears out my views
