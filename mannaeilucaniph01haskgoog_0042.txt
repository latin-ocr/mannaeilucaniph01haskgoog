LUCAN IN FA VOUR xxvii

ment, if not all that could be wished, was at least tolerable:
and with the mob ol Rome the young prince was popular. But
aiter the murder of his mother Agrippina he seemed to throw
oli all restraint. Among the many-enormities by which he
earned the hatred and loathing of Roman society none more
impressed¹⁸ his contemporaries than the vanity, combined with
lack os dignity‚ which led him to exhibit himself in public on the
stage and arena. He loved to appear as the first of harpers and
chariotdrivers; and the harpers and chariot-drivers bowed to the
necessity os submitting to the claims oi one who could and would
enforce them. He loved also to write verses and recite them to
applauding audiences; and here he became the rival ol Lucan.
(18) Lucan, the pet os the first literary circle in Rome,
had probably attracted the notice¹⁹ of the young emperor soon
aiter he came to the throne. But Ι see no means of de-
termining the exact date ol the honours he conferred on
Lucan, the quaestorship and the augural priesthood. The
quaestorship and entry into the senate*⁰ regularly went to-
gether, and the legal minimum age was 25 years. This would
bring Lucan’s quaestorship to AD 64, which is too late; and
besides we are told that he was not os the required age.
l think that it was probably soon aster the festival'¹ Neronia,
first held in 60 ; on which occasion Lucan made his first appear·
ance before the general public os Rome and recited a pan'egyric
on Nem. Thereiore I incline to place it in 61, and l find that
Genthe had already arrived at the same conclusion. Be this as
it may, it seems clear that for some time aster the year 60 no
open rupture took place. Indeed we should rather inler that
the relations between Lucan and the emperor were oi as friendly
a character as circumstances would permit. But slowly and
surely rivalry was leading to jealousy and jealousy to hatred.
