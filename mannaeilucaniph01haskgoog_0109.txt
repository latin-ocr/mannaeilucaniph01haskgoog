xciv PROSODY

I now proceed to Pompey's words in Lucan book vn.

(ε) ‘I pray you keep from me that worst oi lates, degrada-
tion in my declining years',-that is, in the years os
my last meridian, the fourth or Western meridian os
Manilius. It is an astrological notion that reminds us
os, but is not the same as, our metaphor os ‘lise’s
sunset'.

That the meaning of cardo in the language oi the gromatic
writers is closely connected with that discussed above is easy to
shew, but l do not see any passage in Lucan to the under·
standing os which this connexion is a direct help. The Eastern
or Western ‘North-and-South-lines' are nothing more nor less
than the Eastern or Western meridians.

As the identity oi a painter shews itself in certain peculiarities
oi colouring or manipulatim, so does that of a poet in peculi-
arities os diction and rhythm. But perhaps more attention is
nowadays bestowed upon the case oi the painter, which appeals
to the eye, than upon that oi the poet, which must be decided
by the ear. Yet that the diction and rhythm os a poem are
among its important characteristics will hardly be denied by a
carelul reader of the Aeneid or Paradira Lost. In the caseos
Lucan this lineos inquiry has special interest: for, though it is
easy to note in detail the numerous traces oi Vergil's influence
on the writer os the Pharsalia, itis none the less true that
the effect of the whole poem is anything but Vergilian. Indeed
it cannot be said to bear a general resemblance to any other
work in ancient literature that has come down to us. It stands
between the old Rome and the new, not only in its subject and
spirit but also in its rhythm and diction.

The general effect of Lucan's verse is one oi steady monotony.
Looking more closely we observe certain distinct reasons sor χ
this effect, which are in the main as follows:
