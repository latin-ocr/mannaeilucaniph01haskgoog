NERO ΛΝΒ THE EMPIRE xxxix

heis really thinking os the similar story about the mother·
slayer Nero. While reading in the spirit os allusion-hunting I

once fancied that the description⁸ os the νεκυομαντεία in the
sixth book was inspired by Nero’s sailure in a like enterprise:
but it seems that the attempt os Nero was alter Lucan’s death.
The notion would thenqbe absurd‚ and the introduction oi such
a passage simply explained by its being drawn from a common-
place-book. Whether the same may not be the case with the
passages about incest and matricide l must leave some one
more competent or confident to decide.

Much greater importance attaches to the question whether
the digression in the ninth book⁹ on the site os Troy is in any
way connected with Nero's appearance as patron of the llians
shortly belore the death of Claudius. ll it be so connected,
then it not only renders the above-mentioned doubtful allusions
quite improbable, because a retum to complaisance alter such
hideous insinuations is hardly to be conceived,—but it will also
colour our views as to the lull signifieance of some passages
which we shall presently discuss. ll it be not—and such is my
decided opinion, for the llian origin ol' the Julian house was
devised before the Aeneid‚ and the matter would readily suggest
itsels to a writer lond os digressive description and steeped in
Vergil,-—then nothing is affected by it, and we proceed un-
hampered on our way.

Ι pass on to the consideration of passages where the refer-
ence is not to Nero but to the Empire of the Caesars. These
lines must be quoted in full.
