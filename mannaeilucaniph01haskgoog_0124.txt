RELATION TO VERGIL cx

authority as the historian os Imperial Rome, but in this matter
Ι am compelled to record my dissent from his view.

Ihave collected a great number ol passages on which the
contrary opinion may as 1 think securely rest. These passages
might be classified under three heads

(a) those in which it is quite clear that the words os Lucan
are an echo of the words of Vergil.

(b) those in which a word, a turn of phrase, a construction,
or the sound of a line, are curiously alike in the two
writers. of these Ι have only given a selection.

(c) those in which the wonderful correspondence ol geo-
graphical details, proper names, legendary lore, and
other such material, is marked.

1 have not so classilied them, because many passages would
have had to be repeated.

It should be remarked that many os those belonging to
(b) would is taken each separately seem to be of no importance.
Casual resemblances will ever be sound in poems written in the
same metre and language. But when the resemblances are very
numerous, when the line or lines ol the earlier poet occur in or
near a passage already proved to have been well known to the
later poet and certainly imitated or echoed by him—then the
case is materially altered, and the value os this class ol evidence
becomes manifest. Now anyone who careiully studies the
parallel passages quoted below will see that the most remark-
able characteristic os the parallelisms in general is the way in
which disproportionately large numbers are lurnished by certain

, parts os Vergil.

1 hold therefore that Lucan was steeped in the language of
Vergil, and closely familiar with his matter. I think that
a priori probability-a poor thing in itsell—tends also to this
conclusion; sor the popularity os Vergil was immediate, and
Seneca’s frequent quotations from his works suffice to prove that
this popularity extended to the circle os society in which Lucan
was brought up. Again,we find Lucan’s contemporary Calpurnius
a manifest imitator ol' the Bucolics. Indeed so universal was
the influence of Vergil that the best great division os Roman
Literature is that into ante· and post-Vergilian.
