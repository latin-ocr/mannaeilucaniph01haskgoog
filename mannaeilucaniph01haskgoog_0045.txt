xxx PLOT FAILS. DEATH OF LUCAN

soul with notions of a Roman constitution and a Republican
liberty in themselves historically untrue and which even as
ideals were no better than an idle tale. ,And while he thus
inflated his sels-conceit and nursed his wrath he lost the last
traces of common sense and power of self-judgment. “blind to
his own inexperience of men and his unfitness to conduct a
delicate and momentous enterprise, he plunged into the con-
spiracy with hot vehemence and became one of the leaders of
the plot. But while he boasted and fumed the news came ,
upon him that all was discovered and himself betrayed. Then ι
followed a sad scene of abasement and shame. The young
Stoic begged for his life. He was ordered to give the names '
of accomplices. At first he refused. he was then offered his
life eas the price of bet t.rayal It was useless to quest ion the ³
good faith of the offer, which could only be tested by accepting l
it. It was equally useless to name strangers or slight aequatur-1
anees: for his previous hesitation would not be accounted for,
and further inquiry, probably torture‚ would follow. Lucan
shewed what he thought of his own position when he accused
his mother Acilia. We have no reason to think that the charge χ
had any foundation, and we are told⁸² that the lady was not
molested in consequence. Lucan however did not escape by
means of an act almost worthy⁸³ of the matricide Emperor
. himself. When he received the order to die, he had his veins
opened in the approved fashion⁸‘ and died the theatrical death
of a Roman Stoicos those evil days.
(28) So perished Lucan, leaving his revenge unattained,his r
pretensions to Stoic virtue unjustified, his Pharsalia incompleta. ³
