lx WHO IS THE HERO? N

¹xt³⁴f⁰l¹2 but free. True to bis principles, he is unmoved by the lrorrid death-s that

dim-²¹ make the march hideous, sadly and stemly he gives his orders and pushes on:
he bears the worst of every peril: in his presence the voice of complaint is
hushed, and the tortured victims die in peace. With the end of this march
we again lose sight of Cato. If there is one part of Lucan's design the non·
completion of which we may justly regnet, surely it is the famous death scene
at Utica, which the Stoic poet doubtless intended to pourtray.

Such is Lucan's Cato Those who are familiar with the
contemporary references of Cicero and the speech recorded by
Sallust⁵ will see that it isin its main outlines a truthful picture.
It is true that we miss the cross-grained perversity that moved
the mockery and complaints of Cicero. So far'the picture seems
onesided. But it is to be remembered that it was precisely in a .
great crisis like that of the civil war that Cato would appear to
the best advantage. Of course the portrait is coloured bya loving
hand: but it is none the worse for that.

Cato was too much at variance with the corrupt politicians
of his age, too deficient in pliability, too little able to employ
the best of possible means for the attainment of the best attain-
able ends, too much in fact of the hard narrow-minded masterful
Roman Stoic‚ to be a successful or practical man in times of
comparative peace. But the Cato of Lucan—even ifwe grant
that he is more of a concrete ideal than a human character—is
essentially great, and, if we judge him by his own standard, es-
sentially successful If as a man he has not the true-balanced
mind and masterly harmony of Caesar, by the side of poor wordy
vacillating Pompey he is simply colossal. Itis his ‘vain faith
and courage vain’ that alone lights up the dark hour of the falling
Commonwealth. Such men are ever misunderstood in their life-
time; and we may well believe that Cato expected nothing else,
and that to him the loving admiration of posterity would have
seemed a fitting and sufficient reward. Manilius⁶ sets his soul,
with the rest of the good and great, among the stars of heaven:
there he,fortunae victor, might live a congenial life in his aetheria]
home in calm enjoyment of the Universa.

in the Pharsalrb. The Senate as a powerful governing body was ³
of course a thing of the past: it could only be known to Lucan
as such from books or from the prejudiced and inaccurate de-
