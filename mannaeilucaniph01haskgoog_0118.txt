USE OF CASES ciii

vires maturae mortu habere? 935 attractam martem ac-
spuit.

To these we may add pignus, paudus, robur, papuli, saecula,
etc.

We see this tendency beginning in Propertius, but he seems
singular among his contemporaries. With Lucan we find it
established in Roman literature.

(b) Use of cases.

The soealled ‘accusative ol respect' is much rarer in Lucan
than in Vergil. There are however a good many instances such

’ as 11 335-6, v17o-1, 518, v1 625, 658, vn 586, v111240, 752,

1x 171-2, 842-3, x 83, 84, 134, 137, 309.

A few instances of the genitive aiter adjectives and participles
may be worth noting‚ though they are lor the most part not
innovations: such as ΙΙ 578 metuens pelagi, vn 373 damini
affluentem, VIII 811 pavidos maris, VI 106 liber terrae, 301 libera

legum, vn 118 libera fortunae, 240 aeger morae, 1x 373 annonam.
fidens.

· Genitive singular aiter neuter singular os adjective substan·
tivally used.

11 υἱὲ-9 paruam sanguinis, v 467 minimum terrae, x 253
tacitum mundi.

The dative, especially the so-called dativus commodi and its
tribe, is used boldly and sometimes harshly. Examples are
necessary.

11 547 ut Catulo iacuit Lepidus [compare Gratius 315 sic et
Achaemenio cecidisti, Lydia, Cyro, Comei Severus ir 13
124 nostraeque caderes serus Hannibal irae], v 343 lau-

manum paucis vivit genus, VII 451-2 astra Thyestae .

impulit, lx 259 quad tibi non ducibus vivas morerisque,
x 115 stabatque sibi nan segnis aeleatas (cs V11697 etc).

In 11 126 neglectum malatae dextrae the dative is harsh: the
construction looks differently when the person and not a limb
ol him is mentioned, as X 177 nan neglecte deis.
