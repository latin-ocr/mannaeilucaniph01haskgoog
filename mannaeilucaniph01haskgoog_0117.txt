cii SUBSTANTIVES AND ADJECTIVES

New adjectives are not very common, and are seldom happy
inventione. Specimens are the following, mostly ἅπαξ λεγό-

va.
με 111406 bellax, vl 22 quassabilis, v111 175 inocciduus [Sen

epigr 36 Baehrens], 111 408 irredm, 941 karmivagm.

Some rare words seem taken from Ovid, such as
v11480 resonas, 111 670 saxfficus, 677 colubrifer.'

The neuter of the adjective is very commonly treated asa
substantive. Vergil does this to a less extent, Horace osten.
Specimens are

1530, 1v 55, 111423 serenum, 11389, v111490,1x 404, 563,
571 honestum, 1V 248 iustum, VIII 488 utile, rectum,
111 189, 577, x 180 verum.

As to the forms of nouns there is little to be said except
that the genitive in ii, made popular by Ovid and others, is now
regular. Lucan has auxilii, coniugii, corm'lii, eloquii, imperii,
naufragii, servitii, solstitii.

ln Χ 187 we have the unique fastibus [abl os fasti] and in
lv 520 felix [acc neut] is so sar as Ι know only supported by
the use os the nominative in quod bonum faustum felix...siet,
where it does not stand alone. For vn 391 natale [abl] see

Roby1§§425,427.

Nothing is more remarkable in Lucan than the extreme
fluctuation in the sense ol certain substantives. Nisard [11 pp
238-45], who holds that metrical convenience has had a great
deal to do with this abandonment of the comparative precision
observed by the Augustan writers, selects the following speci-
mens:

fides. 1467, 11 17, 254, 705, v1433,v11 192, v111 688, 111 585,
etc

foedus. 180, 11 378,1v 365, 111 1048, x 471, etc.

mors [with letum],
satum, fortuna.
