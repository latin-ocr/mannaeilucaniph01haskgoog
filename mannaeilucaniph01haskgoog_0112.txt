ELISION. ENDINGS xcvii

field, and that Lucan could not free himself from its influence.
Youth also has probably something to do with the delect of
Lucan’s verse: and, though the cases are not quite analogous‚
he reminds us of Oldham in Dryden’s lines

Ο early ripe! to thy abundant store

what could advancing age have added more?
lt might (what nattue never gives the young)
have taught the numbers of thy native tongue:
but satire needs not those, and wit will shine
through the harsh cadence ol a rugged line.

A noble error and but seldom made,

when poets are by too much lorce betrayed.

(c) Τοο sparing use oi elision. In Vergil’s hands elisi0n³
was a powersul rhythmic appliance: by it he was able to load
or roughen lines or parts ol lines so as to regulate the move-
ment; and thus he makes sound and sense agree. In this
respect Lucan's rhythm⁴ is decidedly weak. The same may be
said ol Ovid andos the post-Vergilian poets generally. l believe
that false rhetorical training had a great deal to do with this
delect.

(d) Want ol variety in the endings ol lines. The
spondaic ending occurs in the Pharsalia sourteen¹⁵ times only,
and in eleven os these fourteen cases the last word is either a
Greek word or a proper name or both. Still the number ol
such endings would not seem so very small were it not that the
spondaic is almost the only abnormal ending employed by
Lucan. There are only two⁰ other cases of variation and the
last word is Greek in both cases.

(e) Slovenly assonance of endings. This unhappy
jingling is frequent, and mars the sound ol some of the best
passages in the poem. A few instances will illustrate this
defect clearly enough. For brevity's sake I give the endings
only.
