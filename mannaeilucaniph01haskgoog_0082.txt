SENTENTJAE lxvii

lx 211 scire mori sors prima viris, sed proxima cogi, 403-4 gaudet
patientia duris: laetius est quotiens magno sibi constat honesturn,
583 pavido sortique cadendum est.

x 407 nulla fides pietasque viris qui castra sequuntur.

Iam aware that Ι may have missed some; but not many, I
think. At all events Ι leel confident os this, that on the score
of number there is little to be said. They are not very numerous.
l now pass on to the more important question os their quality.

We must remember that Lucan's mental training had con-
sisted principally os school rhetoric and Stoic philosophy. Both
influences tended to develope a taste sor sententiae and the
. faculty os composing them. To sententiae his uncle Seneca
attached no small value, as his practice shews: and he directly
delends⁶ their use as an engine ol practical ethics. Remember-
ingthis, and considering also the enormous mass ol sententious
utterances existing even now in the works os Lucan's Greek and
Roman predecessorS,—and what now exists is doubtless buta
small percentage oi the total existing in Lucan's day‚—-we
surely are driven to expect avery high standard of productiori

to justily Quintilian's praise. Surely the sententiae ought to
be either original in matter or striking in expression. or both ol
these, if we are to regard the writer as sententiis clarusimus.

Ι am of opinion that these requirements are not adequately
met by the sententiae of the Pharsolro. The matter os them
is sor the most part trite and commonplace, and many of them

merely convey the same tone os cynicism over and over again
in various forms. The expression is now and then good, but
seldom very striking or neat. In short my inquiry leads me
to the conclusion that Quintilian is judging by a low standard,
and that Lucan has not attained a high one.
