xcvi RHYTHM

v11 192 Euganeo, si vera fides memorantibus, augur ......
548 illic non regum auxiliis collecta iuventus ......

vni 513 causa data est; quid sepositam semperque quietam ......

1x Suo-1 tumidos iam non capit artus
informis globus et confuso pondere truncus.

942—3 iamque illis magis atque magis durescere pulvis
coepit et iu terram Libye spissata reverti.

Here and there we even find a line recalling the stately
rhythm ol Lucretius. For instance

vt 487 bas avidae tigres et nobilis ira leonum ......
vn 833 Threicias hiemes, ad mollem serius Austrum ......
tx 290 floriferi repetunt, et sparsi mellis amorem.

Sometimes there occurs a variation from his common models
without any corresponding advantage, as ior instance

V1 701 manibus etmihi sunt tacitae commercia linguae.

or sound and sense are at variance, as in ⁵

v 437 cum glacie retinente fretum non impulit Ister.

How sar this sameness of rhythmic movement is due to a
certain dulness ol ear born in the writer, how sar to the influence
os the salse rhetoric os the time, an influence under which the
Latin prose period used by Cicero and Caesar was last perishing,
Ι see no means of guessing. But that it was not peculiar to
Lucan 1 infer from the lew surviving fragments² os about the ’
same date, and from the ingenious but monotonous volubility of
the Metamorphoses ol Ovid. Ovid's hexameter seems to mark
the transition srorn that ol Vergil to that ol Lucan—so lar, that
is, as we may venture to regard thern severally as types. Is we
compared together Lucan and Ovid only, their differences would ¹
strike us more forcibly than their resemblances, and naturally: χ
sor between a facile writer on a trivial subject and a nervous
declaimer on a theme os world-wide interest the difference is
likely to be enonnous. But when we consider how closely Lucan ¹
had studied Vergil, and how little his rhythm is indebted to
Vergil, we may I think fairly conclude that the smoother ¹
Ovidian versification had taken possession os the Roman poetic
