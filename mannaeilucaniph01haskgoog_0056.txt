NERO AND THE EMPJRE

ln a few passages the direct reference is to tyranny or
monarchy in general, touching the Empire indirectly.

1670 cum domino pax ista venit.

1161 uter imperet urbi.

To these and other less notable lines of the same tone add
the frequent references to the murder of Caesar and tyrannicide
in general, and our body of evidence is pretty complete.

And now—to what conclusions does this evidence lead us?
We have flattery of Nero: we have tirades against despotism :—
do we infer (a) that he began by liking the Emperor, and as he
went on grew to loathe both Emperor and Empire, or (b) that he
hated both from the first, and praised Nero in irony, or (c) that
he is content with the Emperor throughout, but loathes the
Empire? For my part I cannot see any direct evidence of
personal hostility¹⁰ to N er0, and I do not think that his praise of
Nero is ironical. But 1 do think that bitter loathing of the
Empire is one of the chief, if not the chief, influences that
animate the poem. Are we then to conclude that this loathing ²¹

of the Empire—Tyranny, as he calls it-means that Lucan , .

seriously desired and aimed at the overthrow of the imperial

monarchy and the reestablishment of an aristocratic Republic? 7² ¹.'
