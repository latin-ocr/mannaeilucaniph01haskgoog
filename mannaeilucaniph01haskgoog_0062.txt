VIRTUE. GOOD AND ΒΑΗ xlvii

absolve the vile wretches ily whom the deed is done. Fate may render all the virtue
and bravery of Cato fruitless, but Cato is in the right, indeed his approval of the lost
cause is expressly set against the gods' support of the winning one-victrix causa deis
placuit, sed victa Catoni.

(f) Virtue is rational activity conformable to Nature, that is, to the
universal lav 01 the world and the essential constitution of the being,
which in the case of man is reason. It is rational seli-control. Zeller
x n r, a a.

The Stoic idea 01 virtue is 01 course expressed in the character of Cato 11 380
foll, and stray touches here and there. Brutus [11 239 foll] admires his serenity, but
he enters into the war not under any delusion as to Pompey’s ambition [11 3¹9 1011],
and after Pompey’s death he takes the lead, calm unbiassed undeceived as ever
[tx 19 foll, 18'8 foll]. He is unswayed by emotions, the personification 01 virtus
dura [1x 50, 445, 5621: conquest is with him the preinde to mercy of a cool con-
temptuous kind [1x 298-9l. lle knows no fear [tx 371—3]‚ and freely expresses hta
knowledge 01 danger and readiness to face it [1x379f0111. He sets the example of
aelf-abnegation [tx 500 foll, 587 foll]‚ and aelf-devotion [tx 604 1011]. lle is conscious

of his virtue, and talks like an oracle [rx 564 foll]. His bearing and presence inspire
his rnen with wonderful endurance [tx 881 foll].

Good and Bad are absolute notions, admitting no degrees. So the
Virtuous Good or Wise man is absolutely good 3 the Vicious Bad or
Foolish man is absolutely bad. There is no mean; for the value 01
an action depends on the intention, and so virtue admits no degrees.
Zeller x n-c

The true illustration in Lucan of the absence 01 degrees of Good and l3ad is to
be found iu the characters of Caesar Pompey and Cato. Lucan must have admired
Caesar, to judge by the portrait he has drawn 01 htm; but not only was he the
overthrower of the Senate, he was known to lean‘towards the school of Epicurus.
Thercfore he can do nothing right, and the ceaseless malignity with which Lucan
attributes to him the worst of motives seems to us pitiful and childish. As for
Pompey‚ the attempt to make him into a hero actuated only by the very highest
motivas is perhaps the greatest historical blunder of the Pharsalia. Cato is specially
interesting &cause into his mouth are put the lines tx 569 foll an noceat vis ulla
bono, Fortunaque perdat opposita virtute minas, laudandaque velle sit satis et num-
quam successu crescat honestum? scimus, et haec nobis non altius inseret Hammon.

(g) As the tendency to independence‚ to live for oneself alone, to
dispense with society and cultivate the inner freedour of virtuous life,
leads up to the condition of the sels-sufficing Wise Man 3 so the ten·
dency to follow the social instinct and live for the common good, to
seek society and cultivate the social virtues, leads up to the condition
of the Citizen of the World. Zeller xrr u 1, xrv a r.
