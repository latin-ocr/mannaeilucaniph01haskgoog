that henceforth the sword must decide. Onward he presses with relentless
speed. Fortune favours his cause and plays his geme for him. In a vigorous
speech he explains ιο his army that both he and they are compelled to light,
that they have a good prospect of victory, and that they will be fighting
for the best interests of Rome. The wavering scruples of the men are over-
come by a centurion, who declares his intention of following Caesar wherever

he may go. All is enthusiasm, and the general calls in the' detachments of
his great army for the civil war. Panic goes before him, the swift and dreaded
conqueror of the North. He thirsts for war and loves to force his way in the

Ι teeth of opposition: he will be stopped ογ nothing, but he will not lose a

chance of shewing his magnanimity by mercy. In vain does Pompey retreat
from Rome ιο Capua and from Capua ιο Brundisium: Caesar follows at his
heels with the pitiless speed of a destined conqueror, nil actum credens cum

· quid superesset agendum. When Pompey gives him the slip and puts to sea,

he marches back ιο Rome, first providing with masterly forethought for filling ’

tlte bellies of the sovereign people. The Italians receive him in fearful silence,
but little he recks of that: he can trust them to fear him, he cannot trust
them ιο love him. It is the same at Rome, his own Rome, so weakly
abandoned by his rival. He is bent on his main objects, and will brook no
opposition from silly dreamers While Pompey in Epirus is slowly assembling
a world in arms to fall before the luck of Caesar, Caesar is off to Spain in
order to secure his 'rear by completing the conquestos the West. His
promptness has left him time for doing his work thoroughly, and Massiliam
delere vacat. No religious scruples or fears are allowed to cause delay: the
gods may shitt for themselves, but Caesar must be obeyed. leaving the
siege to a lieutenant, he continues his march. The short campaign of Ilerda
shews his versatility patience and cool judgment in a most striking manner.
Superior alike to the weather and the effect of his own mistakes‚ ιο natural
obstacles and the temptatione of revenge‚ he plays the game, always as the
assertant, up to the inevitable checkmate. Ιι matters little to him that a
few men perish in a small naval affair in the Adriatic: and their death by
their own swords, refusing quarter, adds a moral strength to bis army hythe
example of their devotion. What though Curio be cut off with his army in
Africa? Caesar’s wisdom had given him troops representative of Pompey's
army rather than his own, and thus suffers little material and no moral loss.
On his march back from Spain he is brought into the uttermost danger by
a mutiny of his own troops, who are weary of the war. His nerve never falls
him, he boldly faces the men, mique timui non metuens. He completely

overawes them, and the affair ends by leaving him stronger than before. γ

Halting at Rome, he causes himself to be made consul for the following year,
and thus becomes the official representative of Rome οιι the battle-field. He

is at once off to Brundisium, and in spite of the time of year and an un-

timely calm lands his men safely on the Illyrian shore. The great champions ,

are now faceto face, but Caesar must lie quiet till Antony follows him 1

with the rest of the army. His impatience leads him to venture on the
wintry sea in a fisherman's boat. With incredible hardihood he dares a
terrible storm‚ cool as ever, though the fruit of all his toils and perils is in

ιαμ-Μ jeopardy. He isdriven back ιο shore, and upbraided bybis devoted troops 3
