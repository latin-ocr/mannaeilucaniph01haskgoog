(a) Want of variety in the pauses. What can bc done
by such variety in Latin had already been shewn by Vergil,
no doubt at the cost of enormous but congenial labour.

Ι Two oi Lucan's favourite pauses¹ are aster the strong pen-
themimeral and hephthemimeral caesuras, as

157 sentiet axis· onus! t 50 igne vago lustrare iuvetl
58 orbe tene medio. Ι 61 inque vicem gens omnis amet. l
63 sed mihi iam numeni 68 immensumque aperitur opus}
72 nec se Roma ferens. Ι 82 crescendi posuere modum}
77 excutietque fretuml 84 invidiam Fortuna suam}
93 impatiens consortis erit!

When the ear is trained to notice such things, the constant
recurrence ol these and other pauses becomes quite painiul:
such sameness of the rhythmic beat is an artistic crudity that
may be excused but cannot be made pleasing.

(b) Want of variety in the rhythm os successive lines
This is a grave delect even when not emphasized by marked
pauses; and here too Vergil had shewn the better way. Take
such a passage as 11 16—42. The matter is such as might
have wrought mightily on a Roman poet and found its utterance
in memorable words oi noble sound. But through weakness of
rhythm and diction the passage is dull and commonplace. The
same may be said oi a great many other passages3 and when
the matter has no particular interest os its own the effect is of
course worse. That Lucan could have given more rhythmic
variety than he has done may l think be proved by lines, of
Vergilian ring that lie here and there imbedded in his work.
