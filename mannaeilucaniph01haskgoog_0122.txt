rantnrque babuisse parem, 77o-1 nulla dubii discrimine
Martis ancipites steterunt casus, V1 134 nimbusque ferens

arcus aperta mente fugae.

These shew license pushed to an excess sometimes grotesque
in the extreme, and very characteristic of the literature of this
period. Rhetoricians competing in audacity had irreparably in-
jured the language. In the crabbed phrases of Persius and the
slovenly style of the elder Pliny we see the natural result.

(e) Into what shapes of obscurity dark and involved
Lucan could tortore the clearest of languages may be seen by
referring to the following passages:

1 86, 98,111 23, 328-9, 410—1, 1v 243-5, v 278—82,473
—4, w 482, v11 1-3, 436-9, 504—5, 1x 398-402.

The following references will illustrate the bold or careless
way in which Lucan sometimes arranges the words in a sen·
tence. The same sort of thing occurs in the older writers [see
Vergil Aen vll 305-6,XI1 64-5, etc] but hardly I think to the
same extent as in Lucan.

1 14,111 679, v 321, 387, 680, 691-2, v171o-1, v11685
-6‚ 1x 193-4, 232-3.

(s) Relative clauses are thrust in very clumsily, breaking
the flow of the sentence, and giving a prosaic effect, as for
instance 1 14 iun 'quem civiles hauserunt sangnine destrae, 111 14
—5 tenemus Eumenidas quaterent quas vestris lampadas arenis,
v sao—1 malli consurgit Amyclas, quem dabat alga, tora. And
in general we find the relative used in Lucan very freely, as in
prose writerS, awkward though it is in verse.

Parentheses are sometimes long and clumsy, stopping the
flow of a sentence altogether, as lx 305—11, or they break an
antithesis, as x 383.

(g) The subject of the verb is sometimes awkwardly
changed as 1v 34-5, v 371-2, 1x 37-8.

Sometimes the object of the verb is omitted, as 11 279, 728,
1v 353, v 298, and it is sometimes far from easy to supply it.
