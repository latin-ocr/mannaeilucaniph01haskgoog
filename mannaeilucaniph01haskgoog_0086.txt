APOSTROPHES lxxi

’ The influence of the rhetorical schools is very plain to see in
v 319-ῥ4 [Caesar to mutinous troops], 481-97 [Caesar to
Antony], vm 622-35 [Pompey's absurd dying soliloquy],
1x 1014-32 [l Pothinus to Caesar].

That influence may be well illustrated by comparing 1v
344-62 with Quintus Curtius vul 14 ξ 42, v 682—99 with ·
Curtius 1x 6 ἓξ 6-15, and Ι111 848-80 with Curtius rx 3

ἐξ 5-15 and the first suasoria of the elder Seneca: it will
'be felt that these passages (and scores of others, no doubt)
. are merely school commonplaces.

lt may also be interesting to examine pairs ⁸of answering

speeches, such as v 739-59, 762—90 [Pompey and Cornelia],
vir aso-329, 342-82 [Caesar and Pompey], vm 2624-327,

331-453 [Pompey and Lentulusl.
Of Lucan's apostrophes there is not much to be said. There

are in them many fine passages-some of his very best rhetoric, .· .'
—but their effect on' the poem as a whole is bad. The reason is . ·’

clear; they arethe outcome of an unhealthy seli-consciousness. -
The poet’s business is surely to develope his moral by the ’
simple interaction of characters and circumstances. The reader
should be left to judge: half the pleasure and most of the profit
of poetry lies in the discovery of the moral significance of the
characters and the meaning 01 the story, not by direct state-
ment, but from the story and characters themselves. Now
Lucan is always thrusting himself forward to tell us what it
all means: and, whatever Roman audiences may have thought
of the practice, on us the effect is simply to destroy the illusions
of poetry and bring us face to face with an orator. The
' apostrophes are particularly dominant in the seventh and eighth
books, and their undoubted merit, taken as passages, do'es not
serve to compensate for their destructive effect on the poem
generally. A fine instance 01 this class 01 writing and the
c'ourse it naturally follows is lv 799—824, where we begin
with an address to Curio 799-804, thentum to party leaders
generally 805—6‚ next we moralize 807—10‚ then address
Curio again 811—3, then return to our moralizing 814-24,
and close the book and the passage with an epigram
