All this savours of a young unripe mind, void of clear notions and

definite conviction—such a mind in fact as we may on general grounds
infer that of Lucan to have been.

(85) Relation to Religion.

After considering the relations of Lucan to contemporary
philosophy it may not be out of place to add a few words on
the religions of the age and his references to them.

(a) The break-up of the old Roman beliefs in the latter days of
the Republic was followed by the great statedirected revival under
Augustus. In its outward observances the national religion, a medley
of indigenous and imported* elements‚ was to a remarkable extent
restored. But the ancient faiths‚ if they bad ever exercised a sway over
men’s minds and controlled their lives, had long lost this power and
could never recover it again. Not only had Greek speculation destroyed

the intellectual basis of belief, but the characters attributed to the ¹
¹ gods¹⁷ served to diegust the good and furnished an excuse, if such were

needed, to the votaries of vice and cn'me.

No wonder then that Roman society turned to the East and to
the West for the satisfaction of its emotional or quasi-spiritual needs.
Under the Roman tolerance of alien worships‚ only interrupted now and
then for reasons of state, new gods and new systems of religion were
soon domiciled in the great city. From Syria and Asia Minor and
above all from Egypt came the Oriental cults of excitement and mystery‚
with their orgies initiations mutilations and symbolisms: and crowds
were drawn after them. The Jews too, worshipping the one and
invisible god in sullen scom, found protection and won nota few¹⁸
proselytes. Rome was even invaded by the horrid divinities and dark
superstitions of Britain and Gaul.

· Patriotic orthodoxy suppressed the Druidical religion in Rome and
eventuaily‚ for reasons of policy, crushed it also in its native seats
