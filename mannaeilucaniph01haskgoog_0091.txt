lxxvi NARRA TI VES AND DISCUSSIONS

passages are often of considerable merit in themselves, and the
objection fairly to be urged against them is that they are un-
suited to this poem, some to any poem.

When Lucan discusses” the causes of the civil war in a
passage which, if not original, is certainly a powerful and
pointed one, we feel that we are out of the proper domain
of epic poetry: it is all cold and analytical.

When Pompey on his way to Brundisium makes a speech
of 65 lines⁸³ to his soldierS, the reader seels that if both right
and might are really on the side of the speaker the fact ought
not to need so lengthy a proof. When the poet de‘sires to say³⁴
that Pompey's success before Dyrrachium, if well followed up, ⁴
would have saved much unnecessary bloodshed by ending the
war then 3ηά there, he does not say simply ίΑΙι, if only Sulla
had been in Pompey's placel' he goes on to tell us what
would not have happened if he had been. The temptation
to moralize in detail is too much for him. The reflexions³⁵
before and after the great battle are so fine in themselves
that they disarm criticism: still they are rather fine as de-
clamation than as sense or poetry. The same is true of the
noble lines³⁰ the burden of which is ‘Better to fall with Pompey
than win with Caesar'; 3ηά of the ferocious and malignant
picture⁸⁷ of Caesar and his 'men after the battle,a sort of
attempt at literary vengeance in a lost cause.

A melancholy instance of misused opportunities is the de-
scription³⁸ of Caesar's visit to the Hellespont and Troy, where
the effect of the situation is lost in the attempt to moralize
and-catalogue at once.

The reflexions³⁹ on Alexander suggested by Caesar's visit
to his tomb are another case of the ruinous effect, from a
literary point of view, of this tendency to run off at length
into a sermon where what was needed was one or two power-
ful toucheS, such as stimulate a reader to make the‘s'ermon
for himself. As instances of the discussion of natural phe· ¹
