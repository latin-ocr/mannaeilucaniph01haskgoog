lxii THE HERO. CONCL USION

’Μῦν πᾳ own ruling days„ There is also one hard hit at the slavish senate of later
{712ssss times The tenth boolr contains a reference to the murder of Caesar by the

fsgtwr Senators in Bc 44, and another of no importance.

I confess that to rue the part played by the Senate in the
Pharsalra does not seem on the whole a very grem and glorious
one. ln the fifth and eighth books, and partly also in the seventh,
they do shew to advantage. In the first and third they as cer-
tainly do not. The references scattered about the poem are
mostly mere declamatory party phrases, indifferent in respect of
my present inquiry. Therefore Ι cannot admit that the Senate
is the hero of the Pharsalica· I cannot even believe that Lucan
consciously intended it to be such. lf he did so intend-and
all things arepossible in a boy poet—he has utterly failed, for ’
the representation of this supposed corporate hero is (if I may so
say) only subheroic, and meagre to boot

(41) Wanted,a heross, such is the position ofa critic of
the Pharsalia. We are now in a position to sum up the results
of our search.

The hero a'e sacto is Caesar. He is the impersonation of
power, and in spite of Lucan’s attempts to blacken his character-
which fail from being overdone—he has a moral greatness that fits y
him to be the hero of a greater poem than the Pharsalia. y
If Caesar is power, Cato is moral greatness: he is a sort of
secondary hem. i

Pompey cannot be called a hero in any sense. He is the
protagonist of that political and military Rome the utter rotten-
ness of which he only partly understands, and the fall of which he
is too timid to hasten.

The senate is legality, and is in effect only part of the fore· ,
ground of the picture, important in its relation to the chief figures. l

It is very characteristic of Lucan that it should be necessary
to search after the hero at length. And when we have found him, g
heis a hero not in virtue of the poet’s efforts, but in spite of ³
thern. This is the Nemesis that follows on an attempt to mis ’
represent history. Lucan is borne on the stream of declamation 2
