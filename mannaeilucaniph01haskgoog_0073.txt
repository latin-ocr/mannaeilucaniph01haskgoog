lviii WHO IS THE HERO?

comes to herself, he treats her to a short oration, upbraiding her in what we

should consider an unmanly tone. She replies in amuch higher strain, and

*1¹¹¹ ι391011· Pompey weeps. The Lesblans declare their loyalty to him, and he takes
3333591311. leave ol them with a blessing. He knows not where to turn, and leaves
*¹¹¹¹ 203· 'his destination to chance. His comrades begin to rejoin him, and his first
, thought is to restore his cause by launching the hordes ol Parthia upon Rome,
using the claim ol old services to stir up the Parthian king. This is Pompey

v111256-327· the patriot, the hope ol Rome. In a Cilician port he harangues his company,

to seelr refuge and succour in the East with the Parthians; he had rather

not take this step3 but if this lails they must seek some sar-off asylum beyond

the bounds ol the civilized world. Anyhow it isin the East that his name

vrrr 32⁷·455· will be most powerlnl. This pitilul oration finds no favour, and he is at once
rebulred by Lentulus in a speech too long by hall but good in spirit. He

advises a retreat to Egypt, and to Egypt they go. Then comes the treachery ·

vnrsotps. os the Egyptian court. Pompey has no plan: he is warned by his friends,

afraid not of violence lrom the Egyptians but ol a disgracelul submission on

boivs meekly to his sate uttering to himself a hortatory speech, flabby and vain
to the last.

Such is the character, drawn by Lucan himself, of the man
on whom he lavishes⁸ his warmest admiration and praise. The

picture has at least one merit, it explains Pompey’s fall, lor it
is sar more true to the original than Lucan's comments would
lead usto expect—one may almost say, than Lucan meant it to
be. ¹

Its main defects are jealousy vanity and slowness. Pompey
is too jealous to be conl-headed, too vain‘ to be clear-headed,
too slow to seiae opportunities He cannot bear a rival, he
cannot recognize a superior, he cannot justify action by vigour
or ambition by daring. His shallow nature cannot work up to a
firm decision based on a clear cool judgment os present facts, and
then carry out that decision at 311 costs with the energy ο1 con-
viction. He is never really convinced himself, and he may be
said to aim at persuading others rather than convincing thern.
His patriotism is at the bottom but vanity and selfishness. Such ¹
a man was perhaps fitted to be the leader ο1 an 311313 aristocracy: ,
his technical slrill sufficed lor ordinary varlare. But civil war
demands a moral soree that is born in a man, and is not to be
