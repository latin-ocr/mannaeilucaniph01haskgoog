l REFERENCES TO RELIGIONS

But it was impossible to suppress the Eastem worships, which had
taken so firm a hold of the popular imagination. The tnrth is that
for the time they met to some extent a want with which no philosophy
could deal. And under the influence of Oriental ideas the Roman
religion underwent a most important modification in the introduction of
ι the worship of deceased emperors.

Still there was one thing wanting. lf there was one power in which r

Romans generally did believe, it was the ‘Manifest Destiny' of Rome.
Accordingly there was growing up the worship of the great goddess
Roma, the personified might fortune and glory of the mistress of the
ancient world.

Such are the features that especially draw our attention in reviewing .

the state of religion at Rome in the age of Nero. But amid all this “

the ancient worships went on undisturbed. And to some of them,

traditionally derived from Troy, a greater importance than ever was ,

now for family reasons attached by the emperors of the Julian line. Δ

(b) 1 have given the above short sketch ln order to supply a grouping for the

following references in Lucan. 4

Egyptian gods are mentioned rx 158-6, x 158-9, their introduction into Rome
vr11 831-3, the refusal of Egyptians to worship deilied emperors seems alluded

to vrrr 86 .
Jewish god is sisokerr of 11 soa-3 dedita sacrat incerti Iudaea dei.

Gaulish gods and religious tenets usages etc appear r 444-6a, 111 399-425. ¹

Lucan seems to have felt considerable interest in this weird and sanguinary
system.

Worship of deceased emperors is often referred to in seornful ternas· See vt 809
et Romanorum azanes calcate deorum, vu 455—9, vtrt 835, 859-64‚ rx θοι

Roma as a goddess calls fora few remarks. There was not sofar as 1 can discover
any temple dedicated to her in Rome till the temple of Venus and Roma built

by Hadrian. The worship began among the astute Greeks in the days of the ἶ

Republic, and it appeared in many provincial towns as time, went on. The

goddess is represented on coins, like other tutelary goddesses, as wearing a murat
crown. Hence Lucan speaking of patriae imago appearing to Caesar says 1 188

tumgero canos effundens vertice crines. He attributes to her a divine character 7
1 199-200 suntntt'qwe o vervecinis instar Romu, fave coeptis. He also persenilies ,

her in other places as vlt 373 atque ipsam domini attinentem actumve Romam,
vrri 3²² Roma, fave coeptis. less striking instances 1 omit: buti conceive that
1 have shewn ground for believing that Roma was in Lucan’s time recognized
as a divinity, though her formal worship had not as yet been established in
the city itself. For details conceming dea Roma see Preller’s Romische Mytholoffie

For the old Roman worships see especially 1 195—9, ix 990-9, where the at h. Ἴ

ment of the Iulii to the Trojan legend ts clearly marked. Α
