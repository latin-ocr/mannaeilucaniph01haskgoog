lvi WHO IS THE HERO?

fortune can relax, whose intrepidity no danger can appal. This
man sees to what the Roman Commonwealth is tending‚ he airns
at what is possible, and will thus be able to guide its destinies.
Useful forms he adopts, useless ones he discards. No frenzied
priestess, no witch, no watcher of birds or scrutinizer of sheep’s
livers intluence his judgment ; while he calls to Rome and the
great Roman gods for approval, his real trust is in stout hands
and loyal hearts and the ascendency of the Julian star. He
believes in himself and others believe in him. His strategy is
no mere soldier’s technical skill; it is an exercise of practical
psychology, and movements directed to the productiori of par-
ticular moral effects produce those effects with the certainty of ¹
fate. Lucan, blinded by his own prepossessions, sees this but
darkly‚ and hence is ever harping on the luck of Caesar. Caesar
is ready to use victory with mercy and generosity ; but that he
may be generous and merciful the victory must first be won. It
is idle to call him¹ a traitor or a fiend3 he is at least as much
of a Roman as any of his contemporaries, and he is not so
roolish as to fancy that men can fight without shedding of blood.
, His is the one sane and steady mind among a generation of
dreamers blinded by uncertainty and prejudice. He is even

Pharsalia. What sort of a man does he appear as we follow him
through the poem?
