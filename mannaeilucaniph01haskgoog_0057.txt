xlii RELA Τ ION TO PHILOSOPHY

Ι think not, and sor two reasons, If there is one thing in
which he does'believe, it is Fate: and Fate had declared¹¹ ior
a monarchy. Moreover, crude though Lucan’s political notions
were, he does shew traces of having learnt that without a manly
seli-respecting aristocracy and a patriotic commonalty no Re·
public was possible. Such at least is the inserence l draw from
his references¹² to the servile Senate and mongrel plebs ol the
Imperial days He had caught the tone oi the Stoic circle in
which he moved. He acquiesces in the ordinance of Fate. But
Fate might soon ordain a further change. Lucan had also
caught the tone of the reactionary senatorial eliques. This
tone is still prevailing in Tacitus so great was its vitality. ’
The young provincial, writing as a Roman of the Romans,
¹lalls into this tone naturally enough, and probably he is carried

' away by the llow of declamation and says sar more than he ι
seriously means. of course he had no real¹⁸ knowledge os the
Roman Republic, and whatever genuine hatred os the Empire
had grown up in him from personal experience was probably ι
no more than a youth's impatient desire lor greater oppor- ,
tunities ol shining' ιιι a literary career.

My conclusions therefore are very nearly the same as those ἵ

at which Dean Merivale¹⁴ arrived years ag0. Iam glad to find i
that this rs the case: so much the better lor me. But Icannot i
agree with him in thinking that Lucan did not ‘regard the
principate as a tyranny ἐ the evidence to the contrary, the more
Ι examine it, seems only the more overwhelming.

(34) Relation to Philosophy.

(a) That Lucan was brought up as a Stoic we know, for ζ
he was the nephew of Seneca and pupil oi Cornutus. It is ¹
however a study not devoid os profit or interest to note the ι
traces of Stoic intluence' ιιι the Pharsalia. This I proceed to do l
under several heads, adapting statements oi doctrine srom Zeller l
