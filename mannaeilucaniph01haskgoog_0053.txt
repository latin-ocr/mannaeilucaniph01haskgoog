xxviii RELA TION TO

treat of his relations to Nero and generally to the Imperial
government.

In the opening¹ of the poem we meet with the famous
passage in which he courts the favour of Nero by the most
grovelling flattery. All the horrors of the civil wars may be
regarded with calmness or even satisfaction if they were merely
the antecedent conditions of the advent of Ner0. Nero is in
fact a god, and this address fills the place of the invocations
customary in epic poems. What Apollo or Bacchus were to the
singers of old, that is Nero', the centre of Roman hopes, to
Lucan.

The next topic in which we mayl thinlr certainly see a ·
reference to Nero is the favourable' handling of the character
of L Domitius Ahenobarbus Nero belonged by birth to the
Domitian house, and we know⁸ that the connexion was not for-
gotten. This Domitius great-greatgrandfather of the emperor,
is mentioned in connexion with the affair of Corfinium; as
commanding the Pompeian right wing at Pharsalia; as desying
with his latest breath⁴ Caesar· who had before given him his
freedom and his lif. He is indeed the most fierce and im-
placable foe of the Caesarian cause.

Several other passages have been supposed to bear a more
or less direct reference to Ner0. Such are the following. The
description of the amburbium and other rites is taken to be
drawn from the ceremony of purification performed⁵ by Nero in
AD 56, at which Lucan would naturally be present. This in-
ference seems to me probable enough. It has been thoughl⁶
, thatin the passage where he expresses the Roman abhorrence
of the incestuous laxity of Orientals Lucan may have had in
his mind the scandalous stories about Nero and his mother
Agrippina. This conjecture does not satisfy me. At least, if I
accepted this, Ι should find no difficulty in believing that when
he speaksl of the Furies pursuing the mother-slayer Orestes ,
