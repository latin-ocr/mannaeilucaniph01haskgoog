SPEECHES

speeches and apostrophen

(4⁵) Lucan, says Quintilian¹, is magis oratoribus picam l
poetis imitandus. This is in a passage where he is passing
poets in review and estimating them according to their relative ’
values as ‘good reading' for a student ot' oratory. Ι take ¹

· him to mean that the menits os Lucan’s treatment and style

’ are rhetorical, not that all the speeches in the Pharsalia are
appropriate or judicious. Accepting the criticism in this sense, ·
I go on to examine briefly the speeches, selecting a few sor ¹
special comment.

Their general characteristic is formality: they are set'ha-
rangueS, without individuality²or spontaneousness. Their warmth
and ‘spirit-for Lucan is, as Quintilian says ardens et concitatus,—
is the warmth and spirit of a elever young orator, not that os
the supposed speakers.. The same objection may be taken' in

⁴· a greater or less degree to all speeches written by. poets or
ss historians for their characters In Lucan this general resem-
blance is made more striking by the extravagance os the
arguments used and the excessive ingenuity of the turns ol
'thought But when all deduction is made on this score we *
must still admit that tsome ol these composit ions are admirable, ÷
and Ι myself think them the best part of the poem. One κ
or two of the best apostrophes take a higher flight; but on
the whole the speeches bear examination better than the apo-
strophes
⁴ Among the best tspeeches are I 299-351 [Caesar to his
troops], IV 212—35'[Petreius to his troops], VI 777--820 [the ⁶
corpse], VIII 484-535 [Pothinus to Pt,olcmy] Ix 379-—406 i
’ [Cato to his troops: down to 394 very good]‚ 566-84 [Cato i
the Stoic]‚ 1064—1104 [Caesar on seeing Pompey’s head]
x353 53-98 [message of Pothinus]. ῑ

ln worse tast e are VIII 72-85 [Pompey upbraiding his wise], 2
and Ix 5 5-*108 [Cornelia who says she has only lived to deliver
Pompey's message to her sons, laments too loudly and too long:
with almost ludicrous truth she says os her anima that planctu
concrema peribit} ·

2Αῐι instance is the speech given to Cicero was not nt Pharsalia. ¹
