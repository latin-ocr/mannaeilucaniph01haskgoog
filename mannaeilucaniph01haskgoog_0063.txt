xlviii LIFE AND DEATH. NON-STOIC ELEMENTS

Both these tendencies are working in Cato. The former is sufficiently illustrated
by what is said above. Cato's devotion to his country is also one of the most con-
spicuous features in his character. His aim is patriae impendere vitam. Rome to
him fills the place of wife and child. He makes the bereaved commonwealth his
ward [rx 24 toln, and counts death nothing for her sake. His devotion to the service ,
of.humanity is complete. it is his part toti gmitum recredere mundo. But this
humanity probably includes Romans only in the first place, tbe'rest of the world in
a quite secondary sense. ’

(a) Life and death are in themselves indifferent Suicide is

, sometimes allowed and even enjoined. When it has, owing to circum-

stances beyond our control, become undesirable that we should live
longer, then it is time for us to assert our freedom and depart. Zeller

Lucan's utterances on the subject of death are specially interesting hom tbe ,
circumstances of bis own end. ⁴
’ lu t 459-60 he speaks oi the fear of death as timomm metimus. In 111 39—40
be makes Pompey say aut nihil est sensus animis a morte relictum, aut mors ipsa
nihil, in vlu 749 Cordus says si quid sensus post fata relictum est. In vt11632 „
Pompey says non fit morte miser. In tv 517 foll Vulteius declares that to die is
a blessing the greatmss of which is only disclosed to those whose end is near,
and hidden from the rest. In his own person he says 1v 575-81 non tamen ignavae
post haec exempla virorum percipient gentes quarn sit non ardua virtus servitium 4
fugisse manu: sed regna timentur ob ferrum et saevis libertas uritur annis, ignoratque ’
datos nequisquam serviat enses. mors, utinam pavidos vitae subducere nolles. sed 3
virtus te sola daret. Cato says tx 211 scire mori sors primarias, sed proxima 4
cogi. It is curious to find that in vn 470—r di tibi non mortem, quae cunctis poena ¹
paratur, sed sensum post fata tuae dent, Crastine, morti, and in vt11 395. death is t
spoken of as a penalty. But in v11818 libem fortunae mors est it appears again
as a relief, and in v 117-8 it is cithera penalty or a reward. One of the most
striking passages is in Vulteius’ speech tv 478 foll, vita brevis nulli super est qui
tempus in illa quaerendae sibi mortis habet, nec gloria leti inferior, iuvenes, admoto
occurrere fato. omnibus incerto venturae tempore vitae, par animi latis est et quos

(a) After noting the genera] Stoic tone of Lucan it is necessary to
remark that we have no ground for thinking that he was' so impregnated κ
with Stoic doctrines as to be a consistent disciple of the Porch. He is ¹
or fancies himself deeply impressed with the wrongsul predominance ol ’
chance¹⁶ and indifference of the gods. Hence the prosperity of the
wicked, 111 448-9 servat nrultos zvarana nocentis et tantam miseris ¹
irasci numina possunt. Accordingly we find him now and then breaking
out into utterances of distinctly Epicurean sound, as when he doubts
