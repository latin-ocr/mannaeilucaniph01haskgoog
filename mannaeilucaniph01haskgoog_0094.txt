(a) One ol the most striking characteristics os Lucan’s
style is seen in the sorced antitheses which abound in his
lines. Sometimes they are felt at once to be a fit and power-
sul vehicle lor expressing a contrast or opposition of notions,
which enlivens the narrative or speech, but on which it is
unnecessary to dwell at any length. Such a case is 11 572
territa quaesitis ostendit terga Britannis. But few os thern
are as good as this: in general they seem to come in merely
because Lucan cannot resist the temptation to state a point
cleverly3 and the effect is strained and artificial. The following
instances are os very various merit, and will serve to illustrate
my remarks.
