TO THE READER

Wusw Mr Haskins asked me to write the Introduction to his
edition of Lucan I gladly consented to do so, moved by the wish to
renew our former association in a small edition of the first book.
Little did Ι think to what a siae the work would grow, or how great
would be the labour of producing a result still lamentably crude and
incomplete.

The literary criticism of the Pharsalia isan eminently interesting
problem. From the death of Ovid to the birth of Lucan is barely
, a quarter ofa century: a gap of fifty years or less is all that parts
the literature of the Augustan epoch from the Neronian. The few
minor poets who wrote in the interval have left but a few small
fragments: and the modern reader of Roman poets passes over this
period of silence and finds himself at once in the literature of the ⁸
Annaean circle, the central figure in which is the younger Seneca
It is indeed a startling leap: we are surrounded by writers whose tone
motives ideas and canons of composition differ fundamentally from
those current in the company we have just left. Into the nature causes
and significance of this remarkable change it is part of my business to
inquire.

In doing this it is perhaps unfortunate that so little help is to be
got from previous writers. The work of Nisard, faulty in parts but
on the whole good, stands almost alone in dealing fully and directly
with the problem: and it is too much of the nature of popular lectures
to serve as a basis for serious study. For Lucan's life and writings
Geuthe's dissertation is of great use. How miserable may be the result
of meritorious exertions is shewn by Koerber's paper on Lucan’s syntax.
