os the hour takes up 63 lines²⁸ of unspeakable ioulness and
horror: and Sextus’ interview²³ with her runs to 260 lines
more. This horrid scene despite its ghastliness is not without
a certain dignity oi its own: and the last 3 lines are appropriate
and good. The story’⁴ oi Cato’s march along the north of
Africa gives an opportunity, not to be missed‚ of bringing in
the real and iabled plagues os Africa: which run into the
legend of Medusa and her death at the hands ol Perseus,

os a list oi the local snakes. Then comes²⁸ a list, with names
and particulars, oi men bitten by various snakes and hence
dying various appropriate deaths: this takes more than 100
lines. Caesar feasts with Cleopatra, and we accordingly are
treated to 25 lines²⁷ detailing the luxurious appliances os the-
Egyptian queen. Nor is it only in the narrative that these
passages occur: the speeches are similarly weighted. The
burden is ‘any war but a civil war '‚ and we have 8 linest

lines oi his speech to mere butchery, with names and par-

read ol Curio's landing in Africa without 60 lines⁸⁰ devoted
to the utterly irrelevant story of Hercules and Antaeus. When
Caesar in a great hurry is wanting to put to sea at once, and
chafing at delay, it is ludicrous sor the fisherman to entertain
him with 16 lines³¹ recounting the signs oi bad weather to corne.
