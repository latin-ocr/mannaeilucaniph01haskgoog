Such are a few out of many instances of a correspondente
surely more than casual between the words of Juvenal and
Lucan. Ido not think it will be disputed that the later poet
drew inspiration from the earlier. To what extent he did so,
1 think no mere comparison of line and line will tell us. Rather
we must pass from one to the other in our reading and remark
the frequent likeness of manner and tone. 'sake such lines as
the following:

11 74 consul et eversa felix moriturus in urbe.

¹7¹ omnia Sullanae lustrasse cadavera pacis.

111 439 ...sed expensa superorum et Caesaris ira.
tx 706—7 sed quis erit nobis lucri pudor? inde petuntur
buc Libycae mortes. et fecimus aspida mercem.

Read too such passages as 1V 373-401, v 381-402,vt1 539
-43‚ x 136-71‚ and many more, and it is I think hardly
possible to doubt that the satirist had drunk very largely of
Lucan’s springz-naturally and rightly, for the manner and tone

of Lucan, though unsuited toan epic poem, find their proper
place and function as a vebicle of satire.
