(c) While considering the feats of Lucan in the way of

' antitheses and emphasis it may be well to call attention to

the involved and laboured expression of notions in themselves
clear and capable oi being expressed simply and clearly. Ι take
the instances collected by Nisard 11 pp 246-51‚ as they are
good ones and amply sufficient to illustrate this characteristic of
Lucan’s style.

182—6 [it was the submission to a triumvirate‚ not the power oi an

, enemy, that destroyed Rome], 11 177—80 [Marius was killed with cruel slow-

ness],111 457—61 [the motive power os the towers was unseen, and when they
shook it seemed like the effect oi earthquake]‚ ix 636-41 [Medusa turns to
stone all who look upon her face. For the description oi instantaneous
death ci Seneca nat quaest 11 59 ἕ 13].

These examples might be multiplied to any extent

(d) I append a few stray notes which seem to belong to
this place.

The figure hendiadys‚ so common in Vergil, is very rare in Lucan.
See tv 364 usum belli poenamque remittit, and a few more scattered in-
stances.

The figure hypallage is common in Lucan. Instances are vn 623—4
quis pectore tela transmittat, 834—5 numquam tanto se volture caelum
induit, 111 457 [turres] nullafixerunt robore terram.

(e) Among the characteristics of Lucan's style we must
not sorget the careless repetition oi words The effect of this
is sometimes very awkward, and has sometimes even caused

editors to attempt the emendation of lines which on further
consideration seem to be indubitably sound. A sew instances
will illustrate and justify my words.
