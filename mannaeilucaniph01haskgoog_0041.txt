. Lucan, puffed up with presumed merits and the applause of the
lecture-room, became a shallow rhetorician ‘intoxicated with
the exuberance’ of his own fatal fluency, ready to write andv
declaim on any subject in verse or prose at the shortest
notice.

(16) Write and declaim he did, and of such honour as the i
Roman audiences could confer he had more than enough.¹ If
we are to believe what we are told of his fertility¹⁴, it was simply
portentous. A poem on the story of Orpheus, another on the
fate of Troy, another on the nether world3 plays of various
kinds; lighter works, such as epigrams; prose declamations of ·

great fire of Rome, a collection of letters :-such were the
productions¹⁶ of the boyish pen of this youth born in 39 AD
and destined to die in 65. And these in addition to his chief *
work the Pharsalia, the first three books of which are said to

us from the writers of imperial Rome; but the loss of the early
crudities of the author of the Pharsalia will hardly move a keen Ι
regret.

victims of tyranny, looked back on the rule of Tiberius and
Gaius with horror: even a reign marked by prosperity and
conquest had left Claudius an object of scoffing and contempt.
The advent of Ner0, the pupil of Seneca, was a moment of not
