There are thus by my reckoning 79 similes in all, distributed
over the books as follows

I find it interesting to compare the distribution of the 114
similes in the Aeneid

I proceed to consider briefly the similes os Lucan. It seems

to me that we may classify them under three heads according to
their sources

(a) Those from life, that is, within the range of the writer’s
own experience. A very small class, including perhaps a γ
deathbed scene, a street accident, a poisoning‚ and a few
drawn from the amphitheatre and circus. ,

(b) Those from history, mythology, geography, works of art,
books os natural history and travel. These may be called
the encyclopaedic class, and they are very numerous.
