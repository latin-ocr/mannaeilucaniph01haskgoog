ment Before his return to Rome in 49 AD the young Lucan
³ had become a pupil of some grammarian, most probably of
’ Q Rhemnius Fannius Palaenron²¹ whose school was then much
in vogue. Next he would be put under some rhetorician. When
he left this teacher he passed into the hands of Cornutus¹², a
highly respected expounder of the Stoic Philosophy. While
under this celebrated master he is said to have formed a friend-
ship with his fellow-pupil¹⁸ Persius, who in his satires speaks of
Cornutus with admiring love. Among the many promising
pupils in these schools Lucan is said to have been the one
whose precocious cleverness attracted most attention.

(1⁵) Rhetoric and Stoic dogma were an essential part of
Lucan’s family heritage; they were also the staple of his mental
training. For a much-‘petted quick-witted youth, plung'ed into
such a society as that of Rome in the first century of our era,
hardly any training could be more mischievous. ln most natures
the sels-conscious morality of Stoicism tended to beget an un-

warrantable arrogance and contempt for others: while the
rhetoric of the schools made up of phrase-worrying and devotion
to tinsel ornament, was well suited to make young minds
mistake¹ words for things and vitiate a man's taste through lif .
ln an old man perhaps the evil might have been found cor-
rected, his taste mellowed and his pride abased, by the ex-
perience of life and the chastening uses oi the world. But
