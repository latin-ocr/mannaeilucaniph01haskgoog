os Further Spain. After the establishment of the Empirc⁶ by 1
Augustus rest and prosperity returned to the weary world, and
the Patrician Colony grew and throve in the shadow of the
Roman Peace. Among its citizens it numbered many families l
of wealth relinement and local celebrity. .
(13) One of the most distinguished 01 these families was '
that of the Annaei. Annaeus Seneca [about 53 BC—39 AD],·
commonly called the Rhetorician, had passed a great part of his
life at Rome. There he made his mark, and became a well-
known character in the Roman literary world. He had three ’
sons (1) M Annaeus Novatus, the Gallio' known to readers of
the Acts ; (2) L Annaeus Seneca, commonly called the Philo· 1
sopher: (3) M Annaeus Mela⁸. The last-named took to wife ἶ
Αο1110, daughter 01 Acilius⁹ Lucanus a Corduban orator 01 some ¹
note: and their son Marcus received the cognomen of his ,
maternal grandfather.
(14) Rome was just becoming, in a sense and degree which 1
we can never fully understand, the centre 01 the civilized world. l
The fall 01 the Republic had left her supreme in material power:
the Empire had made it possible sor a capable and deserving
provincial to attain distinction in an official career, or to rise
to eminence in the capital without loss 01 sels-respect. The
attraction 01 Rome was irresistible, and to Rome the genius and
enterprise 01 the Provinces was pouring in a teaseless stream. 1
The elder Seneca had made his name there; the younger was ,1
, now there following his father’s example: and thither Mela also l
,removed with his wife arid child. The infant prodigy-for such .
00 doubt the parents deemed him-was to be reared under the
