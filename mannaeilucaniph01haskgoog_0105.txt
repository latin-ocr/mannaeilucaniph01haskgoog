xc ME TAPHORS

Nisard ΙΙ 251 well points out that in 11 244-5 we have a
good instance of salse metaphor: lor labantem dirige, dubium
firma, should strictly be labantem firma, dubium dirige.

Metaphors were already becoming conventional in Lucan’s
time. Such words as mergere, stimuli, imputare, momentum,
premere, are worked to death by the writers os the Silver Age.
I go on to give references shewing the departments from which
some of Lucan's chief metaphors are drawn.

[1111011101] 111 several passages Lucan speaks of the car-
dines, using them to determine the geographica] position ol some
place or phenomenon; and in one line he employs cordo in so
bold a phrase that it seems well to devote a short digression to
this special point. 1 do not possess the knowledge required for
an exhaustive treatment ol the subject, but Ι think 1 may do
something towards making clear one notable meaning oi cardo
and proving that the isolated bold use ol which I have spoken
is merely a trace oi Stoic astrology.

Leaving asideI ssa-3 cardim tellus subsedit, where cardo
has the common sense of ‘axis', the following are the passages
in Lucan:

(a) 1v 72-4 [ol the congestion oi rain-clouds over Spain] .

hie, ubi iam Zephyri fines et summus¹ Olympi
cardo tenet Tethyn, vetitae transcurrere densos
involvere globos.
