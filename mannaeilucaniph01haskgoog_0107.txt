of the aether, and from this begins the falling-away of the fir-
mament and its headlong sweep down to the Nether World.
The third marks the highest part of the heaven aloft: when
Phoebus reaches this he is weary and his horses out of breath;
here then he rests a moment while he is giving the downward
turn to the day and balancing the shadows of noon. The fourth
holds the very bottom of all, and has the glory of being the
foundation of the round world: on it the stars cease their sink-
ing and begin their upward course once more: it is equidistant
from the setting and the rising?

Itis not my purpose to comment on this passage further
than to point out (a) that it assumes not only a lixed North
and South, East and West‚ but also a top and bottom, or
in other words it recognizes three dimensions; (b) that the
contextos Manilius shews that it is cardinal meridians not
cardinal points that are meant.

The figure represents a celestial sphere‚ enclosing within it that of the Earth, and
having marked on it two great circles intersecting at right angles aud forming
four celestial meridians or cardines.

Turning back now to the four passages from Lucan, books
1V,V,1x, letus see whether we can get out of cardo any clear
and consistent meaning. The reverse order will be best for
purposes of inquiry.
