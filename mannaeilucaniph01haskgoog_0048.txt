BOOKS OF THE PHARSALIA xxxiii

expedition oi Cun'o. This isan average boolr ; the apostrophe at the end ls
famous
Only 591-660 (story oi Antaeus) can be strictly called padding.

v. This book is mainly concemed with the concentration in Epirus.
The senate appears in dignity and power; Pompey is hardly heard ol till
the end, when his parting with Cornelia is well described. Caesar’s figure
dominates the book, at one time quelling a mutiny, at another iacing his
rival with only a part oi his forces, at another putting to sea in a small boat
and deiying the storm. The book is an important one, and in spite oi
the absurd description ol the storm l think it rather above the average in
merit

The padding is 6 5-236 [Appius and the Delphic oracle].

vt. The movements about Dyrrhachium, including the overdrawn epi·
sode of Scaeva, make up all the action of this book. Half oi it is devoted
to the affair os the witch, which, though irrelevant, is better than the first
hali. The book is a poor one, and the least essential os the ten.

Padding 333—412 (Thessaly), 438—569 (witches).

vn. The two main themes oi the seventh book are (a) the difierent
feelings oi the leaders and their armies at the approach ol battle, (b) the
' great battle and its result. lt contains a great deal beside this; eg the fine
lines 185-213 on the forebodmgs oi the battle, 387-459 and 632—46
reflexione on the greatness oi the disaster, complaints oi slavery, indignation
at the gods, etc, 847-72 apostrophe to Thessaly,-all famous passages.
ln spite oi much declamation ola wild sort, irrational remarks, and serious
inaccuracy, this is clearly the great book oi the Pharsalia. Lucan is elevated
by his subject, and it is in this book that the interest culminates and the
decision oi iate is made known.

Padding is not a suitable word to apply to the digressions oi this book.

vni. This book contains little ol action, nothing indeed but the ilight

and death oi Pompey. Caesar disappears ior the present. We here pass
from the decision ol iate to its consummation, and at the close oi the book

the main action oi the poem is ended. The extraneous matter is plentiful
in this book, and some might deservo the name oi padding; l mean eg
541-60 [reflexions on Egypt and apostrophe to Ptolemy],692-711 [re-

flexions on Pompey‘s death]‚ 793-822 [D0 on his burial], 823-72 [apo-
strophe to Egypt} Such passages seem much more laboured here than when

throvn oii in the excitement os the death-struggle as in hook vti. Much os
the boolr is very irrational and wild. Still it has a distinct interest as con·

taining the catastrophe, and some passages [eg'806-22] are really fine.

tx. This book is what Greek editors might have called Κάτωνος ἀριστεῖα.
Cato is the hero oi the book : he is especially great in the desert and at the
oracle oi Hammon. At the end Caesar reappears,*hastening on Pompey's
