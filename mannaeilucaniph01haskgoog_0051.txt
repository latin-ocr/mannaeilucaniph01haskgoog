xxxvi RIVAL COMPOSITION OF PE TRONIUS

Pharsalica bella: but the title Pharsalia now in vogue seems
to come solely from Lucan’s own words lx 985 Pharsalia nostra
viaet etc. 1¹ do not think that this need mean more than ‘my
tale ol Pharsalia will live,' and therefore 1 cannot adopt Teuffel’s
bold statement, that this is the authentie title, without reserve.
The other name seems more appropriate, and 1 am content to
remain in doubt where certainty seems out of reach. I should
add, though without laying much stress on the fact, that Pe-
tronius ξ 118 in leading up to his poem or fragment on the civil
war says belli civilis ingens apas,· and the words are with good
reason held to allude to the poem of Lucan.
(at) 1 feel bound to sayafew words here on this poem of '
Petronius at present a fragment of 295 linea. The purpose of
it is unmistakeable: it is thrown off half in rivalry half in 5
imitation of Lucan, in fact rather like our well-known ‘Rejected
Addresses’ though less definitely intended for ridicule Itis
smoother and perhaps more elegant than Lucan; but the im-
! portance attached to mere literary tricks and supernatural ¹
machInery is very remarkable, as Petronius' own words shew it
to have been very eonscious and deliberate
(82) Now Teuffel [ξ 305] remarks that the reason why we 5
⁸ do not find Lucan's name mentioned by Petronius³ in this con·
nexion is that Lucan was then living. With this Ι fully agree. 5
But a new point has now to be considered. The poem is full of
obvious reminiscences of the Pharsalia, chiefly of the earlier ,
part, as is natural. But, if there be also reminiscences of the
later books, then we must believe that the Pharsalia was pub-
lished at its present length (or nearly so) in the lifetime of 3
Lucan. The evidence of such reminiscences is just strong j
enough to make me incline to this view, but not enough to 5
produce certainty. It is as follows : ’

Petronius Lucan

14-6 quaeritur in silvis auro fera et tx 706—7 fiust after passage about
ultimus Hammon Afrorum excuti· Hammon] sed quid erit nobis lucri j
tur, ne desit belua dente nd mortes pudor? inde petuntur huc Libycae 5
pretiosa. mortes et fecimus aspida mercem. 5

⁵ Petronius wns compelled to death early in 66 no, Lucan in 65.
