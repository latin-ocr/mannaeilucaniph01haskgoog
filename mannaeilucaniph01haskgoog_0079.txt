personification of the fleet here is excellent. The frequent de-
clamation against the wickedness and horrors os civil war is
wearisome ; but how vividly is all brought home to the reader
when Lucan bears him down to the nether world and shews
him the same discord at work stirring up the armies os the
Roman dead⁸t

effira Romanas agitat discordia manis,

impiaque infernam ruperunt arma quietem.

ι How solemn is the awful gloom that falls upon the armies before
the deadly struggle, each startled at the other’s appearance⁹2

inque viem uoltus terebris nn'rantnr opertos,
’ et pallere de'ern, galeisque incumbere noctem.

Striking too is his description oi the aster-working oi the battle-
sever on the victors imtheir broken slumbers¹⁰z

invigilat curretis saeuam scelus, armaque tota
mente agitant, capuloque manus absente moventur.

Tender is the appeal oi Cordus to his departed leader as he lays
the corpse on the wretched pyre¹¹; euagrium, quantum potes,
acupeflammam, Romana succense manu. One os the best touches
in the poem is when Cornelia gives to her son the message of

his father, a charge by which she has been cheated¹² into ¹

surviving her husband:

insidiae vnlnere tuae, deceptaque viri, '
ne milei commissas auferrem perfida voces.

Naturally we read of her below¹³, saevamque arte complexa do-

lorem perfruitur lacrimis et arunt pro coniuge lentum. indeed t

in painting the love of Pompey¹‘ and Cornelia Lucan is

singularly successful. The parting in Epirus, when Pompey r

has made up his mind to send away his wife but dares not tell
her oi his resolve ¹⁸, is truly great:

mentem iam uerba paratam
destituant, blandaeque iuvat veretura trahentem .
indulgere merae et tempus subducere fatis.
nacte sub extrema pulso torpore qnietis
