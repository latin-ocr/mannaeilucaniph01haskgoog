xxviii JEALOUSY. LUCAN IN DISGRACE

The occasions of offence were such as the peculiar circumstances
of the two were sooner or later certain to create.
(10) Literary rivalry and jealousy as between ruler and ’
subject can hardly be serious unless the subject is the better g
man and knows it. Then the ruler must call in his power to 3
make up for the shortcoming of his genius, and this must be
resented by the subject. Such were soon the relative positions
oi Nero and Lucan. , Even the servile audiences of the time .
must now and then betray their preference for the gifted young ¹
Spaniard. They remembered how Augustus had patronized ³
men of letters; and indeed the traditional policy’² of the Empire
had been to leave literature free. Claudius may have been a' l
literary pedant3 but at any rate he was an easy-going one. ³
It could hardly be foreseen how dangerous it would prove to ¹
dispute the palm of poetic genius with Ner0. At last the two
met as rivals in a great public contest, and the prize was .

to slight Lucan’¹ by various acts of discourtesy: Lucan replied ἓ
by ill-concealed or open ridicule, and by straining himself¹⁵ to η
shew off the fertility and variety of his taient. Then Nero
directly interposed by sorbidding him¹⁰ to publish poems or recite
. them. Such arethe outlines of the traditional story, which 1·
can see no good reason for doubting. ‘
¹ (ΩΟ) The prohibition was no doubt secretly resented by

many: we can faintly imagine the wounded vanity and bitter

rage of Lucan himself. In an enforced retirement-probably in .
the stately gardens” spoken of by Juvenal-he brooded over
his wrongs. Unless Nero should relent,—÷a most unlikely con·
tingency,-he knew that the career for which he had prepared ³
