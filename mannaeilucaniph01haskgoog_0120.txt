gaietem with a dative = resisting,'1x 373 cingere: to go
round instead os across a place, ‘make a detour round',
685 pertrabat: would have been shortening [cf vl11249],
x 473 aestimat= ganges, is a measure of.

The strained metaphorica} nse of verbs is a characteristic of
the Silver Age, and is well illustrated by
aplicare 1v 629, v 81, v1477, vn 201.
spargere v111 100, 1x 245, 748, x 310. .

Well known Silver Age uses os the following verbs are found
in Lucan, some ol thern very frequently:

eccutere, elidere, damnare, imputare, constare, trahere, tenere,
extendere, erigere, rapere, impelkre, donare, effundere, quaerere.

Many os these usages have their beginning in the Augustan
writers.

The uses os the infinitive in Lucan are worth some notice.
The only instances os the so-called ‘historical' use that I can
find are in the characters os Pompey and Caesar 1 132—5‚
147—8.

The ‘epexegetic' use, originally modelled on the Greek, is
very common in Lucan with adjectives participles and verbs.
I give some instances,

1 164-5 cultus gestare decoros vra nuribus, 465-4 arcere
Caycos oppositi, 510-1 faciles darc ...... tueri difficiles, 11
550—1 leis te qnoque iungere ...... invideo, 111 377 patiens
...... cingi, 697 eximias......ani7nam servare, lv 519 vivere

durent, 753 pugnat non stare, vl 696 avidum confundere,
vll 289 dicae non fallar, 481 dedit geminare, 751 scire

gestare, lx 190—1 maioribus impar ecesse modum iures,
1001-2avidus......pensaremoras, x 57 corrupto custode
Phari laxare catenas.

More remarkable are 1v615 parum fidens pedibas contingere
inatrem [where the sense oi contingere is ei quod contingeret, in
the fact of his touching: Horace epp 1 19 44 is quite different],
vl 416-7 propius iam fata neoveri degeneres trepidant animi
[where we have an object clause with perhaps a notion of quod
moveantw in it].
