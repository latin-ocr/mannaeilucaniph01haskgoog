viii To THE READER.

A short experience oi Weber is enough. Weise's preface is surely one
of the worst compositione that ever made pretence to judgment and

learning. Most of the remarks on Lucan in standard histories are ,
vague or misleading3 and the fact is that il one is to form one’s ,

opinions on adequate grounds one must do the whole dmdgery oneseli. ’

This may have its compensating advantages. But it necessarily ,
increases the bulk oi the work3 sor, in order not to pretend toan
authority to which 1 can lay no claim, 1 feel compelled to print a large
massot material in justification os opinions expressed. In the case Ἴ
ol two crucial questions, (1) who is the hero oi the poem (2) what is
Lucan's relation to Vergil, I have ventured into considerable detail, .
but not Ι think without some result.

This kind oi work brings neither money nor repute. To the very
‘sew who will read these pages Ι look for an indulgent reception. 1 have
had to work under great pressure os various duties and charges, and a
series os intenuptions tiresome but unavoidable. At the same time ¹
there is pleasure in working at literature as literature: and the study ¹
of even a second-rate author is not without its reward

I have omitted a great quantity of matteras irrelevant to my purpose,
and have passed over many remarks of Nisard and Genthe on this
ground. Some are omitted as having neither authority nor probability.
