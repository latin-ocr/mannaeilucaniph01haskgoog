GOOD LINES

unanimam ot' good lines

(44) Beside the grand passages on which the literary fame
ol Lucan must mainly rest, there are scattered about the poem
. a number os lines that catch the attention os a careiul reader
and lead him to form a high estimate os the writer's power.
They are not strictly speaking ‘sentences ’, though many
of them could easily be cast into a gnomic form: they are
hardly poetic touches, though some of thern border closely
on poetry. Sometimes it is a powerlul metaphor that strikes
us; sometimes a good antithesis; sometimes the telling brevity
ol some bold appeal or touch ol scorn. Osten it is no more
κ than some happy and sorcible expression. Now and then it
is not that the meaning is in any way remarkable, but that
plain dignity ol sense is joined to majesty os sound. Many
os the passages referred to elsewhere will illustrate my meaning
as well as the following, which Ι take from a large number os
selections.

1 182 et concussa fides et multis utile bellum.
187 clara per obscuram voltu maestissima noctemss
2ο2 Caesar ubique tuus liceat modo nunc quoque miles.
227 utendum est iudice bello.
279 tua nos faciet victoria cives.
301—2 hoc cruor Arctois meruit diffusus in arvis,
volneraque et mortes, hiemesque sub Alpibus actae?
3¹ 3 Marcellusque loquax et nomina vana Catones.
338 ultima Pompeio dabitur provincia Caesar.
569—70 tum fragor armorum magnaeque per avia voces
auditae nemorum et venientes comminus umbrae.

11 259 accipient alios, sacient te bella nocentem.
313 quicquid Romani meruerunt pendere mores.
382 naturamque sequi, patriaeque impendere vitam.
477 donavit socero Romani sanguinis usum.
515 et nihil hac venia, si viceris ipse, paciscor.
525 lucis rumpe moras et Caesaris effuge munus.

111 169-70 interea totum Magni fortuna per orbem
secum casuras in proelia moverat urbes
zob-7 acciperet felix ne non semel omnia Caesar
vincendum pariter Pharsalia praestitit orbem
