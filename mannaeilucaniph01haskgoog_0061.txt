This Stoic doctrine probably made it more easy for Lucan to fall in with the
habit, very common in ancient times, of recognizing a body and soul as two separate
things and then confusing them together. This confusion as it appears in the Phar·
solra is indeed particularly harah.

In vl 7¹9-23 the umbra and cadaver are present separately at the same time.
The body is called the carcer of the umbro. The witch compcls the soul unwillingly
to reenter the body, and after its message has been delivered she in 82a reversas the
process and helps the fates animam siti reddere. ln vni 759 foll Cordus begs
Pompey manu animmque patmum officiis averte eneis, and it seems that the identity
of the dead man is bound up specially with bis body. And the words mones umbra
animo seem distinct from corpus cadaver cineres in such passages as vlt 770, 776,
vrri 432, 860, [all notable lines]‚ tx r foll, x 33⁶· The soul is however conceived of
as material throughout. In 1x64o-r Medusa is described as congealing the ancleto
or unrbra in the human frume. In V1 bar—3 we read that the ambra of a man
newly slaincanspeak more clearly than that of one who has been sometime dead. '
This well illustrates the extension of the soul throughout the body. ln vrtt 43²-5
Crassus’ unum is supposed to tell Pompey that it bas long hoped for his coming
to avenge the cineus of a nuda umbro, that is, the ashes to which the umbaz belongs.
ln a number of passages nrams and umbra are really in sense equal to corpus. See
for instance vm 434, 696, 747, 751, 834, 837, 841, 844, tx r 51, 963, 976, repa foll.
And in vn 775 cadavera perform the ghostly function of mones.

These instances of Lucan's usage l think it worth while to give here. For a
poet to distinguish clearly between a soul and a body both material was not easy.
Vergil felt the difficulty3 see Conington on georgics 1v475. And Ovid speaking of
the Ferolr'o says in farti 11565-6 nunc animae teneres et corpora stenelo sepulchris
arram nune posito pascr'tur umbra cibo. lf any one will read Lucian περὶ πένθους
he will sce the confusion of notions¹⁸ well illustrated. The curious will see that it is

very old by turning to Odyssey xl 602 [see Arneis’ note ontaoy. He points out l

that identity is in the Homeris poems determined by the body]. See the Druid view
us stated by Lucan 1 454-7.

For the connexion between the soul of man and the great God see rx 573 foll.
Compare Manilius 11 105 loll.

The souls of the great and good find a place among the stars of heaven, as
Pompey in rx r foll, with which compare Manilius 1 754-7 an fortes animae
dignataque nomina caelo corporibus resoluta suis terraeque remissa huc migrant
ex orbe suumque habitantia caelum aetherios vivunt annos mundoque fruuntur? and
the list of heroes 758 foll.

Though all things are bound by the chain of necessity, still in a
certain sense the will of manis free ; hence there is moral responsibility.
Our actions are the produet of universal law and individual character ¹
combined. Zeller v11 o 3.

Lucan clearly recognizes moral responsihility in spite ol destiny. Though fate

decrees victory to Caesar. his overthrow of the senatorial oligarchy is none the less
criminal; though Pompey is doomed to die by a treacherous murder, this does not
