538 iam Phoebe toto fratrem cum redderet orbe
539 terrarum subita percussa expalluit umbra

54ο ipse caput medio Titan cum ferret Olympo
541 condidit ardentis atra caligine currus

545 ora ferox Siculae laxavit Mulciber Aetnae

1 (h) A, few remarks on quantities may not be out of
pace.

Shortening of final o occurs in the words leo, Cato, cardo,
turbo, pulmo, Curio, Scipio, praedo, virgo, tiro, obliuio, ergo,
Carbo.

Short vowel before sm and sp [x 121, lx 5 74].

Vowel lengthened before stin arsis [v 118].

Short e in third person perf indic [stetemnt [1v 771].
Variation in same word [Ι 689 Py’renen, IV 83 Pyrenaeae}

sanguis generally but sanguis 11 338, vl1 635, [see Munro on
Lucr 1 853, Aetna 100, Conington on Verg A x 487].

Greek forms used for metrical reasons, as 1 231 Ariminen,
11466 Auurimon, 402 Ancon, v 375 Hydms, 376 Τ arus,
377 Sipus, and soon.

This list of notable quantities is as nearly complete as I
can make it. There is very little to note under this head, and
it is just this fact that is significant

These notes such as they are may perhaps be of interest to
some, and therefore 1 print them.
