SENTENTIAE

Surely the lad of twenty five years who wrote this stands on ¹

a height lrom which the ingenuity ol a critic¹⁶ who will venture
to determine what he could and could not have done, il he had “
lived out the ordinary span, may be complacently ignored.

Sententiae.

(4³) Lucan is described by Quintilian¹ as sententiis elan's·
simus: it is therefore part ol my business to inquire what is the
lull meaning oi the description, and how iar it can be accepted
as applicable to our author.

The word sententia is used as the equivalent oi γνώμη, and
signifies¹ a maxim or general statement. By the rhetoricians Ι
the word is applied only to such general utterances as have a
bearing upon human life and action. In this sense 1 shall use
it. From being a staple material of early poetry, and an
appliance moderately used by orators in the golden ages oi
Greek and Roman political lile, it had now in the hands os
the rhetoricians os the Empire become an artificial embellish-
ment used with little relevanceor moderation. Speaking os
sententiae Quintilian' says nostres temporibus moda carent. The
elder Seneca spealdng of Porcius Latro says⁴ that he would
sometimes compose nina praeter itas translaticias quas proprie
sententias dicimus, qnae nihil liabent cnm ipsa controversia im-
plicitum sed satis apte et alia transferantur, tamqnam quae de
snrtnna de crudelitate de saecnla de divitiis dicuntnr: lenc genus ’
sententiarum supellectilem vacabat.
