Where Lucan repeats the word in 1110Ι 021110 001100 we are
conscious 01 2 00112111 1101111000 21111 monotony, such as a meagre
vocabulary is apt to eonvey. Where the sense 01 the word 10

much 01 his attempted word-pointing is habitually marred.

(s) One well known characteristic 01 early poetry is the
artless recurrence 01 the same epithets, the same phraseS, even
the same lines, The Homeric poems are the stock instance
01 this, and one notable feature 01 Vergil's style is his conscious ζ
21111 delicate imitation 01 this primitive ballad manner. In
Lucan this has wholly disappeared. The inner variety 01 human ³
life and character is gone, and the outer variety 01 words and ¹
