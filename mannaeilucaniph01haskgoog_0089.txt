lxxiv LISTS AND ENUMERATIONS

oi the same ideas with change ol vocabulary, and is worth
reading caresully from this point ol view, being eminently
typical os Lucan's manner. As Nisard says, he goes srom
the word to the thing, not [τοττι the thing to the word. ’

(b) The plague os catalogues¹² is found more or less in
every part ol the narrative. The age was an age of common-
place-books: it produced Pliny's Natural History. Accordingly
Lucan, ever in excess when he once begins to speak os this or
that matter, falls into the cataloguing vein and wears the topic
threadbare. For instance:

When Caesar is withdrawing his scattered forces from
Gaul we get a list¹⁸ of Gaulish places and tribes in which
two subordinate digressions are imbedded. Pompey’s retreat
to Capua leads to an account¹⁴ os the physical geography ol
Italy, with one digression. The forces gathered to support
Pompey are catalogued¹⁵ at vast and weary length: 125 lines
os it are introduced by 2 good lines of prelace and closed
by 2 passable lines of summary. The dreary episode²⁸ of the
siege os Massalia is spun out to nearly 400 lines ol tasteless and
hyperbolical detail; while the main point, the surrender, drops Ἴ
out altogether. We may be thanklul that the realm and forces ¹
ol Juba are dismissed¹⁷ in 16 lines. The topic ol the Delphic
oracle¹⁸ is better handled, but the moralizing discussion is the
best part ol it. It takes some 150 lines before we get back to
the subject os the war. The storm in which Caesaris caught
on the Adriatic is so described ¹⁹ that at the end ol about 60 lines
we are heartily siek oi it; our impressions os the storm are con-
fused by the bombastic language and ingenuity of material
details, and the whole effect is execrable. It takes 80 lines²⁰
to set forth the physical geography and mythical history ol
