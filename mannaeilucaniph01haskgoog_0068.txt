There seems to be a similar confusion³⁰ of the mountains named Ida, in Phrygia
and in Crete respectirely.

Tbe wild confusion of the geography in the narrative¹¹ of Cato's African expe-
ditionis too long a matter to enter on here. Hammon’s temple is hopelessly mis·
placed. Cato lands in the wrong place and all northern Africa is disarranged.

The Hister is made⁸² to discharge into the Palus Maeotis. Such is at least the
natural inference

Cicero makes⁸³ a speech at Pharsalia urging Pompey to give battle; but Cicero
was not there.

Indians aad Aethiopians are confused⁸⁴ and even the Seres are placed on the
upper Nile.
These blunders and many others are quite natural in a prolific writer about

ao years of age; many os them are made by other writers; some are taken from
Vergil. On the whole, while we conclude that Lucan's learning was inaccurate and
his expressions careless we may well wonder that these deliciencies were not far
greater than we tind them to be.

lt is a piece of astounding audacity or carelessness, when he attributes³⁸ toa
hiemaliote tbe exploit which Suetonius Iul 68, Plut Caes 16, Val Max ιιι a ἕ aa.
all attribute to Acilius a soldier of Caesar. Surely he cannot be right; but the
unwillingness to nemean Acilius [bis mother's original family] on Caesar's side
may possibly account for the perversion.

To enter into a detailed examination of Lucan's perversioris
of history is quite unnecessary. lhave said enough to shew that
he does so pervert it, and the fact is well known and quite

beyond dispute.

Lucan himself holds or thinks fit to profess.
