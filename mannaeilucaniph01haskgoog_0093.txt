lxxviii DEFECTS ACCOUNTED FOR

din of battle⁵⁶ rises to the pure Olympian aether, lar above
the region of clouds and thunder: the sling·bullets melt with
the speed of their flight. Cornelia calls hersels⁵⁶ Julia’s paelex.
Cato draws off the fleet: 300 ships are spoken οἱ57 as 1000.
In Africa a waterspout³⁸ never breaks up: a sandstorm sweeps
the sand even from under a man’s feet: only the looseness
of the suriace earth saves the solid earth beneath srom sheer
destruction by the wind: yet the soldiers are sand-bound by
the piling-up os sand round them. After the region of serpents,
Cato’s men are cheered⁶⁰ by the sight of lions. Alexander,
who turned back from the Satlej, sheds the blood of Indians⁰⁰

on the Ganges. '

(e) The truth ol the matter is that the old warmth, the
human interest, of early 'poetry was dead. In early poetry,
as Nisard⁶¹ well remarks, Man is everything;¹ the scene is
merely accessory: even the gods are only superhuman men.
Such we find the state os things in the Homeric poems. When
we get to Vergil, human interest is still there; but the scene
has become more important, the human actors less s0. De-
scriptive passages are introduced with obvious relish, though
as yet sparingly: eruditiori is an important part ol the poet’s

- equipment, though as yet it is not ostentatiously displayed.

When we reach Lucan, the poetry os the Homeric type is
dead. The men are little more than lay ligures, the scene is
everything. Lucan still tries to draw characters, but the colours
are harsh, the touches coarse, the traits inconsistent. The old
religious beliels were no longer able to supply any warmth.
There was nothing lest sor the poet but to describe· the
material aspects ol things, to display erudition, to declaim
by the mouths of his characters or in his own person. And
it was natural that in the endeavour to awaken by such means ,
