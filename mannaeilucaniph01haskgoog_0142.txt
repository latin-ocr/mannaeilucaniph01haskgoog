in Horace, me relation between the writers is not worth pursuing
at length. It is chiefly in stray phrases and allusions that the

resemblance is detected. The influence of Horace on the Phar-
salia generally is not observable.

To Ovid Lucan seems to stand in a closer relation. Not
only do numberless mythological details seem to come from
the Metamorphoses ,· but (as l have remarked above ξ 49 b, c)
he is in some important characteristics of his rhythm a follower
of Ovid. Great though the difference is between the two, it
is in Ovid that we begin to trace the growth of the smooth
versification which is so unfavourable to the effect of the Plrar-
salia. In the detailed elaboration of detached episodes we again
see a tendency beginning in Ovid and completely established in
Lucan. How it grew up I have pointed out above (ξ 27).

That Lucan used Livy as an authority is very probable, if
not certain, and Ι wish Ι had been able to see G Baieffs dis-
sertation on this subject. The main items of evidence seem to
be these. The name of Crastinus in v11 471 is said to come
from Livy. The story of the augur Cornelius v11 192-200 is
reported by Plutarch as told by Livy. The affair of the envoy
x 468-74 is said by a scholiast to be told by Livy but rather
differently. The affair of . Ganymedes Arsinoe and Achillas
x 519—2 3 is apparently taken from Livy, according to the same
scholiast. Livy (fragm 45 Weissenborn) seems, according to
Jerome, to have eulogized Cato. He was used as an authority
by Seneca (fragm 41 and 48). In the Periochae of books CIX—-
exn are mentioned a number of incidents which reappear in
Lucan with wonderful correspondence of detail so far as these
meagre abstracts enable one to judge. Lastly from Tacitus ann
1v 34 we leam that Livy greatly eulogized Pompey‚ so that
Augustus called him a Pompeian.

Itis worth while to note a few parallels which may prove
that Lucan had read and was at a given moment bearing in
mind passages from Augustan poets now only known by a line
γ or two. I repeat that I do not press these small resemblances;
the point is in no way material to my argument. But it is
better to submit the few lines in question to the examination of ,
others from this point of view.
