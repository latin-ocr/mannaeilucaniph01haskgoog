In such a case as 11 143-4 periere nocentes, sed cum'iam
soli possent superesse nocentes, there is a rhetorical point in the
assonance; and there need be little doubt that it is to the
fashion of the rhetorical schools that this tendency 111 Lucan is
mainly due. But that mere carelessness 01 defective ear has
something to do with it is 1 think shewn by such a passage
as lx 3 55-8

quam iuxta Lethon tacitus praelabitur amnis
infernis, ut fama, trahens oblivia venis;

atque insopiti quondam tutela draconis
Hesperidum pauper spoliatus frondibus hortus.

Here are four lines the rhythm of which is pleasantly varied.
But—not to mention that the only elision is that of the qne
in atque, which is practically none at all-the recurrence of the
termination nis [nls nis nis nis], followed by two words ending
in tus separated by one ending in bus, is hideous‚ let who will
say the contrary. While on this subject let me add that Lucan
almost rivals the famous O fortunatam natam me consule
Romam 01 Cicero in 111 110 100 1111111 Romanas dederas, Fortuna,
regendas.

(f) Imperfectuse 01 0111101011011. Α111101011011 has a
marvellous effect 011 the sound 01 0 line. But this effect is not κ
strictly rhythmic. It only touches rhythm by reason 01 the
various qualities of the letters. By skillul alliteration special
