MEMORY PRESERVED. CONCLUDING REMARKS xxxi

a great celebrity. Yet its title to the name osa poem was
questioned. But the striking vigour os its best passages, the

Roman patriotism it breathes, the greatness of its theme, the
untimely death ol its author and the remembrance oi his early
popularity,-these and other influences combined were sufficient
not to let it die. It was ireely criticised from the first, as we
see from the words os Petronius Quintilian Martial Fronto and
the Life by Vacca. Tacitus speaks os it with respect as a
classical work, and it was used as an historical authority by
Florus and Appian. There are many traces in the later poets
ol a more or less conscious imitation of his lines In Martial
and Statius we find passages directly bearing on his memory
and his writings. These two seem to have been intimate friends
os his widow¹⁶ Polla Argentaria, and to have kept up an ob·
servance os his birthday. Statius' poem addressed to Polla,
known as genethliacon Lucani, is indeed one os our chief sources
of information in regard to Lucan’s lise and works.

to matters on the knowledge of which as it seems to me an
intelligent criticism of the Pharsalia must primarily rest. Itis
no part oi my plan to speak os the 75 or 80 manuscripts³' (which
1 have never seen) or describe the numerous printed editions
from 1469 to the present day. Nor do l propose to collect the

The historian of the Long Parliament, Thomas May, wrote a
continuation³⁰ oi Lucan’s work in Latin verse to the death oi
