(⁵4) This topic cannot he treated at length here. It might
be made the subjectos a complete dissertation. But it would
serve little purpose to prove what is manifest 011 the face of it
that to his grandfather and unc'le much of Lucan's pointed

antithetical manner, hall rhetorical half Stoic as it is, is to be
traced. Reading no doubt that rhetorician's common-place-book,
the suasoriae and controversiae of his grandfather, reading and
perhaps often hearing the Stoic sermons 01 his uncle. he picked
up 131 more of the mannerisms 01 the Spanish school (if I may
so call 11) than we shall ever be able to detect. Numherless
passages can now be illustrated by quotations from the younger
Seneca especially. Resemblances 01 language (Ι almost think
it was Seneca who crystallized the everlasting tanti of the
Silver Age) are very frequent: but this line of inquiry Ι do not
possess either the time or the inclination fully to pursue.

Juvenal’s relatimr 10 Lucan.

(⁵⁵) It would be a long undertaking to copy out all the
certain or probable reminiscences of Lucan in Juvenal, and quite
unnecessary to boot. Ι content myself with giving a selection
of parallels in the writings 01 these two great declaimers and
reserve my commenta to follow them.
