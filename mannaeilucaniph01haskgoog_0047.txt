lowe's book 1 is too slow and dignified3 Sir Arthur Gorges is
too weak and his metre too lowly; May is halting and often
tame; and matters are not mended in the pompous dilution oi
Nicholas Rowe. We may wish that Dryden had turned his
talents this way instead ol to proving how unlike Vergil a strong
translation could be.

(25) ln considering the poem generally it is well first to ἓ

note briefly the contents os the several books, with a lew remarks l

on the structure ol the whole.

1. Down to 66 there is nothing to call for special remark, but thence
onwards to 182 we have a mere analysis ol the causes os the war, aster
which the action of the poem begins abruptly. To me it seems lar too long

., deferred, and this is why the first book is less effective than some of the =
later ones. Besides, at the very beginning of the action we are con· ἵ
fronted with the supematural. The vision of Roma is strangely incongruo'us ¹
here, coming just aster the cold analytical passage, and the effect very
artificial.

The padding ol this book consists chiefly ol 392-465 (Gaul) and 523—

695 (prodigies, sacred rites, etc). “

11. The chief figures in this book are Cato, whose character is brought
out 234—391‚ and Caesar driving Pompey out ol Italy. Oi the lesser figures
Domitius is important, for he reappears in book v11. This book is an ¹5
average one,

Tlpe padding consists chiefly os ‹sy-2 33 (Marius and Sulla) and 399-438
(Italy . ³

111. The main points are, Caesafls return to Rome and doings there, l
and the siege ol Massalia. The latter ol these episodes is so spun out as
to break the general course ol the action in a miserable manner. There is ,
much ioolish matter in the book, and it is certainly the worst os the ten. r
The padding is chiefly 169—297 [catalogue oi Pompey’s allies].

1v. The fourth book is a book os action; 1-401 contain the campaign 3
of ilerda, 402-580 the affair os Vulteius and his cohort,661—824 the fatal
