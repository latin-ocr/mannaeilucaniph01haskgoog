EX CESS OF DETAIL lxxiii ·

words are glibly condensed and read like those of a man
speaking from a brief dictionary of biography.

The Massaliots declare⁶ that their loyalty will stand the test
of enduring the hardships of a siege: they go into particulars in
a way that robs their manful declaration of all its dignity.

While the armies are facing each other before Ilerda a
severe drought is followed⁶ by a disastrous downpour of rain.
40 lines of tasteless overdrawn description bring us to a point
where the effect of the rainfall, plus a simile, plus an apostrophe
to Juppiter and Neptune, are yet to follow

Curio is deceived bya stratagem of Juba‚ and his men are
indeed in a desperate position'. But ις lines is too much to
devote to a description of the distress of the horses and the em-
barrassment caused thereby‚ when the lives of the whole army
are in jeopardy.

Caesar on his voyage over the Adriatic⁸ is becalmed. We
are first told this clearly enough in 6 lines then comes a simile
in6more. But the breeze is not yet. Through 14 more lines
we have to wait‚ knowing all the while that it must come.
And these lines in effect tell us that Caesar was in a dead
calm and wanted a breeze, which we knew before.

The preparations for the great battle move Lucan to
compare⁹ the scene to the preparations of the gods for battle
with the Giants. He then takes 5 gods and works through
them saying something appropriate of each. This is meant
to be graphic and is miserable.

After the victory, Caesar’s men sleep a guilty restless sleep¹⁰
in the Pompeian camp. Down to the words omnes in Caesare
marm the description is really fine ; but then comesa tasteless
double simile, followed by 3 lines harmless in themselves but
quite superfluous,

ln the course of Cato’s march along the African coast the

story of the apples of the Hesperides is dragged in¹¹ on slight
pretext. This passage well illustrates the tiresome recurrence
