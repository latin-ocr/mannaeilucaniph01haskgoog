CARDINES xciii

(δ) (Though there are trees in the uasis) 'even then there
is nothing to keep off the sun when the day stands
poised on the top of the meridian'‚—that is, when the
sun is at the zenith, he is right over the oasis,'and there
is thus no shade.

(y) ‘Parnasus, which rises alost in two peaks, is equidistant
from the meridians of East and West’,—that is, it is
exactly under the upper meridiam or, in modern phrase,
the meridian os Delphi is the prime meridian. Surely
I need hardly remind the reader that Delphi was called

· the earth's navel.

(β) ‘Where his realm is at its longest, it is bounded, towards
the meridianos the West by Atlas, towards the middle
by Hammon's oasis',—that is, instead of defining it by
West and East, he does so by West and the middle: sor
Numidia lay wholly to the West ol the Delphic or
middle meridian.

(a) ‘ Here, where the ocean is reached [iam] held in by the
bounds os the West wind and the surthest meridiam ol
OlympuS, (the clouds), being forbidden to cross the
water, were congested into dense balls (os moisturel’.

· Olympus is the Heaven ol the upper hemisphere, op-
posed to Tartarus: the West meridiari is the lurthest
[so is the East] because beyond it is the lower hemi·
sphere.

That Lucan clearly and fully thought out the meaning os
all these expressions Ι do not ‚maintain: but 1 do maintain
that such is the strict meaning and that we need not wonder
at his lightly employing asa matter ol course the language ol
Stoic astrology.

I now retum to Manilius, who presently goes on to speak
of me astrological importance os the cardines. Os the Western
he says [ΙΙ 833—7]:

ultimus, emenso qui condit sidera mundo,
occasumque tenens submersum despicit orbem, '
pertinet ad rerum summas finemque laborum

coniugia atque epulas extremaque tempora vitae
otiaque et coetus hominum cultusque deorum.
