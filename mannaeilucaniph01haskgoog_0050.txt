DIFFICULTIES. PUBLICATION. TITLE xxxv

Rome, a fatal influence and one mainly instrumental in destroy-
ing then and for centuries to come the higher forms of literary
art. To these recitatione is due that which all critics admit to
be the leading characteristic and great defect of the Pharsalia,
—the sacrifice of the whole to the parts, neglect of the matter
in an overstudious regard for the manner, a sels-conscious tone
appealing rather to an audience than to a reader, venting itself
in apostrophes scenes, episodes and epigrams, an unhappy
laboriousness that strains itself to be first-rate for a moment,
and leaves the poem second-rate for ever.

(28) It is clear enough that Lucan was at a great disad-
vantage in attempting to compose a poem on historica] events
of recent occurrence. Where details are well known, there is
little scope for imagination save in deviation from truth. Indeed
it is far easier to say what Lucan ought not to have done than
what he ought to have done. The plan proposed by Petronius
for writing a poem on the Civil War would surely produce
something radically bad. For instance, how are the Gods to
take more part than Lucan gives thern? will they help Caesar
the freethinker or Pompey the proved failure? The composition
must have been a literary monster. Criticism of the Pharsalia “
must, I repeat, be negative from the nature of the case; and ,
this will serve to' explain the tone of much that will be said
below.

(29) According to the Life of Lucan attributed to Vacca,
only the first three books were published by himself: it is
added that the other seven, which are looked upon as faulty,
would probably have been corrected by him had he lived to do
ic The judgment of the poem implied in this remark isone
with which I could not agree if the quality os the later
books were concerned. But Ι rather take it to refer to a few
roughnesses⁸ of style here and there observable, and 1 am glad
to find that this is the view of Teuffel.

good MSS⁴ is da bella civili. Statius silv 11 7 66 speaks of
